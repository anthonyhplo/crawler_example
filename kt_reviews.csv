Tim Ho Wan,5,"I still dream about the dim sum from this place! Hands down best dim sum on earth! Probably the only Michelin star dim sum place too. Everything was so incredible, I even liked the pork buns. I would almost fly back to Asia just to eat there again."
Tim Ho Wan,4,"Good, but not great. However, the highly rated items are those for a reason. Baked char siu bao is all you need to order here.  They are a level above the rest, and I've eaten WAY too many in my day (not only because I love them but because I'm Chinese and it's a right of passage). I wanted to be completely wowed by this place since it's Michelin starred, but i wasn't.  If I was giving it a rating on the overall dim sum it wouldn't be high. Here are the reasons.1. Ordinary, run-of-the-mill dim sum I usually get anywhere else wasn't extraordinary here. 2. Shumai stuck together. That's right, the wrappers were so close they stuck. And the presentation on those was lacking. Other than that, like I said, the bao was amazing. The service was quick and friendly. Michelin Star just for the bao."
Tim Ho Wan,3,"Coming to Hong Kong I wanted to be sure to try this place out. So many of my friends had gone before and told me how great the food was. It was just two of us so seating didn't tale too long luckily, everyone around had some pretty big groups of people so I advise going in a smaller group to be able to get seated faster. THE PORK BUNS were amazing. Perfectly made and flavorful and not too hot, but so very fresh. Of course we ordered shrimp dumpling, and shrimp everything. One of my personal favorite is eating shrimp at a dim sum restaurant. The dumplings were good and not too thick in skin. You can find all the typical dim sum categories on the menu, and most of the things we ate were pretty good. Customer service was quick pace, well everything was fast paced as it always is at a dim sum restaurant. If you're in the area, go early, its pretty good. If you're not into the super hyped overly followed restaurants probably not your kind of place, but for the experience why not."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Their menu does not have all the dim sum dishes you might expect at much larger dim sum restaurants. However, what they do offer, they do very well and at reasonable prices. There's definitely cheaper dim sum to be had in HK, but the flavor and quality of each dish we ordered at Tim Ho Wan was better than any dim sum I could find in 626 (Los Angeles), and that's a tough market to beat.We ordered the following:- Shrimp har gow: skin was perfect! Not too thick and not too thin, neither dry nor gummy in texture. Each piece of shrimp was freshly steamed, it was simple yet great- Lo Mai Gai: sticky rice in lotus leaves, this dish was very tasty and enough to share. I actually think this is done pretty well at most dim sum places I've been to, so I wouldn't say this is significantly better. Order it if you like it though, it's a must :)- Lo Bak Go: Pan-fried turnip cake that wasn't particularly oily, seemed more steamed and light in texture.- Har Cheung fun: shrimp rolled in rice noodle, sooooo tasty!- Baked Char siu Bao: omg these are as good as everyone says! The bun is a bit sweeter than your traditional steamed char siu bao(zi), so eating one is pretty satisfying. It's light and full of flavor, the Pork filling is sooooo tasty!Cash only, and if you're there around 2 or 3pm on a weekday like we were, there was no queue! We really enjoyed this place, but we ended up going to one dim sum after because we wanted to try other dim sum dishes that Tim Ho Wan doesn't offer. Part of me wishes THW has a larger selection, but then the quality my decrease. So I think they've found the right balance. 10/10 would come back again!"
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Dim Sum in HK is solid and Tim Ho Wan is a must visit.  I'll say one thing to order is their pork bun!  Serious crusted on the outside with a warm toasty bun while the pork is steaming hot and moist.  This my friend is a pork bun!I also ordered other items like the vegetable and shrimp dumplings.  They were good too, but another favorite of mines were the pork spare ribs with the rice; I could eat this all day.  The sesame balls here are good too; the filling is definitely fresh not like the ones you get in the US.  In the end, Tim Ho Wan delivers in every way to my palates.  The wait could be long, but they generally have community seating if you're in small numbers.  I came alone so I would recommend keep your group small if possible to get a quicker seating. - Enjoy!"
Tim Ho Wan,3,"FOOD: with a Michelin Star and a reputation to uphold, Tim Ho Wan delivers solid dim sum. Flavors are authentic and food is fresh made. Selection is pretty typical for dim sum fare- things to try of note are the pork buns and flower (perhaps chrysanthemum) gelatinSERVICE: while they do have an English menu, expect local waiters and service. Helps to have a native speaker. Food comes out quick but don't expect your teapot to be frequently refilledEXPERIENCE: Multiple tables that are bustling from open, it's a simple decor with often a very long line. We went on a Thursday lunch at 1145 and had no wait- once we left around 1, the line was 10+ deep.VALUE: almost all dishes are between 15-30 HKD (~$2-5 USD). Definitely the cheapest Michelin fare you will find, aim on 2-3 dishes per person for a full mealSUMMARY: Tim Ho Wan has a reputation for being the cheapest Michelin Star experience around. While probably true, the dim sum itself was fine and long wait meant that I would probably find a less high profile spot for my next dim sum fix. Worth a try though just to say you've done it!"
Tim Ho Wan,4,"Really good dimsum and really low prices! The place is a bit crowded and small, but that's what most restaurants in Hong Kong are like. I don't mind it at all, but it just wasn't expected for michelin star place. I was surprised how quickly they were able to seat us given the huge waitlist and full restaurant. Service was fast, and we finished our meal pretty quickly. I would recommend the baked bbq pork buns with a sweet crust on top. They were so good, but so was everything else we ordered."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"As noted in other reviews, this location of the Tim Ho Wan chain is the cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant in the world. And for the price, it definitely lived up to the hype. This is easily one of the best meals I've had for under US$20 (HK$160) in my life.We visited for a mid-afternoon lunch and the line was long but not outrageously so. The wait was maybe 20-25 minutes. Other reviews have noted the crowds milling around outside the restaurant, which were definitely a pain, but I don't think it's fair to blame the restaurant for that. Hard to find a really good dim sum restaurant where crowds/lines are NOT an issue. People just love good dumplings. Plus it's pretty easy to push through when you need to.Inside, the space is clean and undecorated; plain white walls, plain tile floor, nothing of note. Typical for dim sum restaurants around here. Servers are busy and running around the place, but there are a lot of them and it's easy to call someone over when you need something. Despite the crowds outside, our table was private and fairly quiet. The servers do gently push you to eat your food and leave, but you don't feel rushed or forced out at the end of the meal.As always, the food is the most important thing, and here is where the restaurant shines. Again, for an unbelievably low price, you can stuff yourself full of delicious dim sum dishes to the point where you can barely move. Standouts were the BBQ pork buns, meatballs, and sesame buns, all of which I strongly recommend. But really you can't go wrong with anything on the menu; I loved everything.Overall, a delicious and fantastic experience and one to which I'll definitely return on my next visit."
Tim Ho Wan,4,The dim sum here was hot steamy and delicious. You check off items on a menu rather than the carts coming around. There isn't that wide of a selection but all of the classics are there. It's a great place to go to if you know exactly what you want but if you're looking to try something new you should go somewhere else. It's a great experience though.
Tim Ho Wan,5,Two words: PORK BUNS.Get them! We ordered two orders for the four of us and got an order to go. Everything else we had was pretty delicious as well. I don't think you can go wrong with any of them items offered. It was kind of difficult to flag the employees down after ordering because they're so busy so make sure you order everything you want... and then some! We got there early.. about an hour or so and walked around for a few minutes then got in line and was able to get in with the first wave. A must go in HK!
Tim Ho Wan,4,"Finally got to try this ""cheap"" Michelin star restaurant in Hong Kong and I think I ordered everything off the menu! I can in a weekday afternoon about 1 hour and 3 mins before they closed and there was no wait. We got seated right away. The seating is kinda tight, and after being seated for awhile we were moved again because our table was awkwardly in the middle. I had the famous pork buns and they were quite good though I felt like I've had better. We tried several of the dumplings, sticky rice, and even the fried taro cake. Even though it didn't look or taste like taro so I don't know if there was a mix-up. Overall it was a tasty experience but it didn't blow me away. For the price, it's worth going at least once."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Known as the cheapest Michelin Star Restaurant for dim sum, Tim Ho Wan definitely lived up to it's hype. This is supposed to be the original location. We read that we should arrive 30 mins before the opening and you definitely should, as a line was definitely growing when we were approaching the restaurant at that time. Once in line, we were given an order form to check off our desired items; they also have an English version of the order list. Tables are shared in the restaurant, so you might be seated next to strangers if your party is not large enough for an entire table. Staff members bring the dim sum to your table when it's ready. And if you want to order more, all you have to do is update your order form and give it to the staff member. The dim sum were awesome and so much tastier than the other dim sum that we were used to. The best had to be the bbq pork buns (cha sui bao). But we also enjoyed the har gao and sui mai. Cash only so be prepared."
Tim Ho Wan,4,"We came here because it was said to be the cheapest Michelin star restaurant and we were not disappointed! Four of us came at regular dinner time on a Wednesday and we did not have to wait. The baked pork buns were definitely the star, and the one dish that stood out. I'm not sure if they're just not common in North America but I've never had baked buns with a sugary crust like that. It's sweet and sort of melts in your mouth. Everything else on the menu was pretty standard, but very well done. Dumplings were cooked perfectly, fried items were perfectly crispy, etc. I think the high turnover at the restaurant makes it so that everything is constantly being cooked and so none of it sits and overcooks. So so cheap, but most everything was cheap to me coming from the US/Canada. Cash only!"
Tim Ho Wan,5,"You know I had to try Tim Ho Wan while I was living life in Hong Kong, right? This should definitely be on your checklist, just make sure you actually check it off. I get it, the lines are SUPER long, the wait time is pathetic, but it's worth it! Trust me, I came solo and had to wait 30 minutes. But I was in food heaven, I tell ya! Tim Ho Wan is known as ""The world's cheapest Michelin restaurant."" Mind you, they used to be a little hole in the wall restaurant in 2011. Yea, yea, I'm sure you already know they were known for their Michelin Star type of dishes, but it is more to it than just that. They are also best known for their delicious Dim Sum. Tim Ho Wan has opened several locations in many different areas of the world, such as Hong Kong, New York, and Hawaii. honestly- I wouldn't be surprised if they make their way to San Francisco. (Humm!) The process is easy. They have paper menus on the table and you check what you would like to order. They leave the menu on the table in case you are still hungry, you can always add on from the menu if you would like. The dishes do come out quickly, which is a HUGE plus! The service is great! My server made sure to check on me every chance they get. The dishes are also very reasonable. Everything ranges from $5-$10. My all-time favorite dishes were the Siu Mai, Shrimp and Chive Dumplings, and delicious Fried Rice (I am such a rice lover!). Did you know they have 29 different dishes to choose from? Choose wisely, Y'all! Taking MTR to get here? No worries! It's located between Prince Edward and Sham Shui Po. I can't wait to visit more locations around the world, but whenever I am in HK, I will definitely make this my last stop before I leave."
Tim Ho Wan,3,"3.8 StarsFirst off, I have heard nothing but good things about this restaurant and especially this particular location because of its ""Micheline Guide"" status. First impressions,  not a fancy looking restaurant inside or out, you would not even notice it if you were walking by if not for the big crowd out front.The restaurant opens at 10am so the 2 of us went and arrived about 10mins after 10am.  Luckily we got one of the last ""tables"" (as we were seated with another 4 people). We ordered:Shrimp Dumplings - very small in size, good flavourChicken Feet - small portion, good flavourSteamed Spareribs- small portion, good flavourSteamed Beef Rice Roll - good flavourPan Fried Radish Cake - found it very delicate, not much substance.The service was really fast, but it was a bit rude.  Their main goal is to turn over as many tables as possible, so it's not a normal dim sum meal like we're accustomed to here in Vancouver.  Overall the dim sum was good but didn't blow me away.  The price surprising was quite cheap especially for Hong Kong.Overall Experience:Service - 6.5/10Cleanliness - 7/10Food - 8/10Value - 9/10Parking - N/A"
Tim Ho Wan,5,"This is the real dim sum, and the means a lot of things. Service is slow, this restaurant is not ritzy, and you need to accept that you will spend the better part of your meal listening to your neighbors chew. This is an authentic experience, and you'd be dumb to miss it. The menu is impressive, and I dare you to think of a staple that they don't serve. I live for the Shrimp Dumplings, and I've never seen anything so succulent and so perfect crafted. It is very difficult to make these not fall apart, and I don't know how they did it. Other favorites: meaty Shu Mai; a fluffy, bare-there Steamed Egg Cake; al dente shrimp Vermicelli Rolls rolls; impossibly tender Spareribs, Steamed Beancurd Rolls - the only good ones I've seen. The Crispy Beef Brisket is melt-in-your-mouth fatty and savory, but this one is really heavy .These are the Baked Buns with bbq pork that put this place on the Michelin map. The pineapple crust is divine, and the bun shrouds the melty, juicy pork like a cloud.I've had ""turnip cakes"", but I've never had Turnip Cakes. Turns out they're not supposed to be bland AF gelatin. These are fresh and sweet, and the dried shrimp gives them a fantastic flavor. Steamed Rice sounds simple, but it's worth a try. It's comfort food: tender ground beef with a runny fried egg to mix in. Dessert takes it up a notch with Deep Fried Sesame Balls filled with custard cream. The damage: 280 hkd. For all that. It's barely $40 US at the market rate of exchange, and in a big city like Hong Kong, it's unheard of to get food this good at a price this cheap!"
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Yes, it is completely worth it to trek to this location. It was so insanely good, it almost brought tears to my eyes. The entire experience was amazing. The chinese cook in the front steaming room making dim sum to the authentic lack of customer service exceeded all of my expectations for a dim sum place in Hong Kong. You can get the high end, good service anywhere but this is the real deal. The most tasty, melty dim sum I've ever had in my life. Like multiple levels higher than the most tasty dim sum in San Gabriel Valley. If you go to Hong Kong (the motherland), make a stop here if you love dim sum and you will be able to tell a difference between the dim sum you've had and this place. Melty goodness."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"I've heard so much about their famous baked bbq buns, I knew I had to try it during my stay in HK. They were soft and warm and the sweet crust was perfect!Also ordered other dim sum classics such as shrimp dumplings, rice noodle rolls, pork ribs, etc. While nothing else stood out compared to other dim sum places I've tried, everything was still very well done. It's also surprisingly inexpensive! For a super filling meal, it came out to just under 10 usd per person."
Tim Ho Wan,3,Traveling on a budget? This a great inexpensive place with quick and friendly service. In order is less than 3 dollars US dollars. They the mango soup with has a hint of ginger.
Tim Ho Wan,5,This was definitely the best dim sum place I had while in HK (but I did only go to three) and the pineapple pork buns alone were enough to see why this place got a Michelin Star. It was crispy but soft and the savory flavor of the pork fell in perfectly with the dough of the bun itself.If you go here you absolutely must get the brown sugar cage and the pork bun pineapple cake! We got a variety of items of around 9-10 dishes and our total bill came out to be $23 usd . That quality. That price. American dim sum will never taste the same now lol.I highly recommend going here. We came when it first opened at around 11 and there was no wait at all.
Tim Ho Wan,5,Its Tim Ho Wan.Get all the classic dim sum dishes and eat until your heart is content.Cheap eats and located all around Hong Kong. Enjoy!
Tim Ho Wan,3,"Well, it does have 1 Michelin star, but the whole experience was pretty mediocre. Came here because this is supposedly the first location of this dim sum chain and plus it was featured on multiple media outposts. We ordered a few dim sum dishes, the prices are ok, although we did find several other dim sum places that had way better tasting food and costed much less. The food was very mediocre in both presentation and taste, considering the prices. The service was fast and efficient but very very basic. We still felt very rushed when technically, dim sum is suppose to be a social thing that takes a long time to eat your meal. The restaurant was also kind of old and beat down, and the table and floors are not very clean. The bathroom was also not very clean. Honestly, we found so many other dim sum places in town that does not have a michelin star but had way better food, cheaper and better service. This place is kind of a hype."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"PSA: NOT ALL DIM SUM ARE CREATED EQUAL. You can categorize this review under the bucket of ""Beating A Dead Horse"", but I am joining the masses when it comes to singing praises for Tim Ho Wan. Every dish on the menu is something you can find in just about any dim sum restaurant across the world, and yet each dish is just definitively tastier than the same dish you've ordered over and over again in your past. Standouts include baked bbq pork bun, steamed shrimp dumplings, phoenix talons in abalone sauce, glutinous rice dumpling, and the egg yolk sesame dessert. We ordered 10+ dishes and the total came out to be ~$23 USD. I will not ever, ever, ever complain about Michelin star rated food for the price of fast food."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Best Dim Sum ever!!! Everything we ordered was tasty. The best thing on the menu was the BBQ pork bun. It was like no other BBQ pork bun I've ever head. Be prepared for a wait and fill out the menu while you wait. Very inexpensive. It cost around $43USD for 4 people, around 12 dishes."
Tim Ho Wan,2,"So over-rated!!  You have to deal with pushy mainland Chinese tourists who don't know how to queue or stand out of the way.  So the entrance is blocked and you have to push your way in when your number is called.  If your whole party is not standing right at the entrance when they call your number, they give your table to another party.  Then your blocking the entrance and people are yelling at you.  The dim sum is fine (nothing special) and if you're here just for the pork buns, there are other places that have better pork buns than this place.  The skins of the dumpling are pretty good, the filling is ok.  The Chiu Chau dumpling fillig is a little fishy, the meatballs have a mushy consistency, and the pork bun itself is sweet and flaky (different - but not super special).  The Soy sauce noodles are good.  The ladies serving are pretty mean.  They are very concrete.  If you want to add or change anything... you can't, and you'll be met with lots of attitude.  They also just slap down your dish on the table as if it were slop.The aggrevation of just getting a table is not worth it.  Let all the mainland Chinese be the new American asshole and eat here.  F ""forget"" this place."
Tim Ho Wan,4,"Finally made it to this establishment. It was not disappointing. The shrimp har gaw was outstanding. So much better than what you'll get at even the better dim sum places in the US. We don't eat meat, so the menu, already not extensive (not a criticism; do fewer dishes better is a good thing), left few choices. Everything was quite good, save for the veggie dish. Getting stir fried iceberg lettuce was not expected. Dessert was delicious. Be sure to get the Mala cake. Final tab was so affordable, especially for such quality. Will certainly return again."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"One of the less busy Tim Ho Wans.  I got lucky the first day (a Sunday morning around when they opened) and had no wait. The second time I tried, a Friday around the same time, there was a one hour wait.  This place is famous for their baked BBQ pork buns, which has a bit of a pineapple bun top to it.  For $20HKD it is a steal of a michelin star.  I had so many of those suckers! So, so good. I come from a heavy populated Cantonese area and these are still the best I've ever had.  The bun is crispy, flaky, airy and filled with tasty BBQ pork.Pro-Tip: If you want to skip the line, just ask to order to-go.  Go up to the register and place your order.  Takes only a few minutes to get your food."
Tim Ho Wan,5,It's how we do Michelin star dining. The prices here are very reasonable and the food is delicious. Just order everything. You really can't go wrong.This was also similar to the new York City location.  Good and I'm glad I didn't encounter a wait when I went.
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Hands down the best dim sum I have ever had. They have each and every meal painted down to a science-- SO CONSISTENTLY AMAZING. The line here starts even before the place opens, and I came here on a weekday (though obviously I didn't have to wait because the restaurant wasn't small and there were plenty of seats).When you are first seated, there is an extra bowl in front of you-- use that to pour some tea in to wash your chopsticks and cups. I don't think their utensils are dirty, so I opted not to do this, but it is tradition for a lot of Chinese people-- so in case you were wondering, that's that!The lotus leaf wrap is by far the most unique thing that I have ever had. It is usually very small and lacking in stuffing when I have it in other restaurants, but you will find yourself with a generous portion of food here. I also LOVED the pork buns, they were like crack. PURE CRACK. IT WAS SO AMAZING, I don't know how I will ever eat any other pork bun ever again without feeling disappointment.Everything else here is amazing too, but I don't have a special need to call them out. This place does not serve milk tea or coffee, but whatever."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Known as the cheapest 1-Michelin star restaurant at the time (2015), it did not disappoint. Everything we had here while we were in HK was pretty good, but the star of the show was the Baked BBQ Pork Buns.When I tried this again in NYC, it just wasn't the same. I'm not sure if it was because they were still working out the kinks, since it newly opened. The only thing that was good were the BBQ pork buns. However, it was overly sweet when I had it in NYC.In Hong Kong, it was perfect. We went right when it opened, so there wasn't a wait. If you go any later, expect a long queue. Definitely try this place in HK because it's the best location I've had it at!"
Tim Ho Wan,3,We arrived 20 minutes before opening on a Wednesday so didn't have to wait at all. They had the usual dim sum items on the menu. They're baked char siu baos were particularly yummy but everything else was pretty average. If you want a decent dim sum experience I'd recommend going elsewhere so you don't need to wait in line.
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Best Dim Sum I've had in my life. I've had a hatred for dim sum ever since my parents forced me to eat bad dim sum when I was a kid, but this place has healed me of those scars. I am too lazy to write about every single dish here so I'll focus on the most important one. BBQ Pork Buns - 5/5. The bun itself tasted like a sweet biscuit and had this amazing, slightly crunchy texture. The filling itself was full of flavor without being overpowering, which was impressive given how sweet the biscuit was already. Easily the best and most memorable thing on the menu, and it would be a crime to not get this here. This is coming from someone who hates BBQ Pork Buns normally, so this was exceptional.The Rest - 4.5/5. Everything else here was at least as good as the best dim sum places I've had in San Francisco/ Los Angeles, which is impressive since it's rare for a place to have so many good things on the menu. The wonton in Chili Oil was interesting since it was just drenched in diluted vinegar sauce, which worked since the sauce was watery enough to not stick onto the wontons. The turnip cake was super soft and had turnip chunks that tasted very fresh. Shu mai and the shrimp rice rolls had the nice fresh shrimp flavor to it, etc etc."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"second time @ THW.?.the original location is near Kwong Wa hospital, near Wah Yun school. Luckily, the wait was not too painful. Not bad at all!Helped a Brasilian navigate the menu, between what he liked, and its most famous dishes. Resisted the urge to go a third time to Singapore's, since I knew there was also a branch there.And now, with IFC ( think coming to NYC too) having its very own branch, omg....I know where my next visit will be:)Food no joke. Yummy and this time, 3 people had more willpower, instead of 2, ordering practically the whole menu."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"This is some of the best dim sum that I have had. The restaraunt is smaller, so my party of three had to wait for an hour and 15 minutes, but it was worth it. We started off by getting someone else's salted egg bun, which was quite good (sorry to whoever's that was). Then, our meal finally came. It started with the baked pork bun. They were DELICIOUS!!!! The filling was sweet yet savory and the bun itself was thin, crispy, and sweet. The shrimp dumplings were quite good, the wrapper was thin so it had more filling than most others that I've had. The turnip cake was good too, the sauce being the star. The beef brisket noodles were delicious and provided some great flavor to the noodle. The eggplant with fish cake in black bean sauce was quite good, and the eggplant itself tasted quite good. The worst thing that we tried was the steamed dumpling with turnip and chives. It was not my favorite as the turnip was quite crunchy and the chives provided little flavor. For dessert we had the osmanthus tea jelly. This was quite good and was refreshing in the 90-degree heat. Overall an excellent meal that I would reccomend to anyone in Hong Kong."
Tim Ho Wan,3,"Overall: 3/5. Quality okay, but overhyped and slightly expensive as a result.Sponge cake (馬拉糕): 5/5.Shrimp dumplings (蝦餃): 4/5.Pan fried turnip cake (蘿蔔糕): 3/5.Salt water horn (鹹水角): 3/5.Steamed rice rolls with BBQ pork (叉燒腸粉): 2/5.Wait time: 0/5."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"I dined at the original Tim Ho Wan in 2011 when it was just a hole-in-the-wall in Mong Kok. The old venue seated 30 people at most and had hours-long waits almost all day long. These days, Tim Ho Wan is an international dim sum empire, thanks to the Michelin rating and associated ""cheapest Michelin meal in the world"" hype this now-closed initial outlet received. Here in Hong Kong there are now many outlets, two of which retain the Michelin rating.This particular outlet in between Prince Edward and Sham Shui Po MTR stations is one of them, and as such it's a good way to mark my 1600th Yelp review. It looks like it can seat at least 100 people, and when I came in late in the day, there wasn't any wait. (In a nod to true Hong Kong-style dining, however, you will have to share a table with others.) Prices have gone up a bit since my 2011 meal, but with most menu items costing HK $15-28 each, things are still affordable given the quality.And on the subject of quality, all the dim sum you order here will be quite solid and satisfying, whether a BBQ pork vermicelli roll (cheong fun), steamed fresh shrimp dumplings (har gow), steamed pork dumplings with shrimp (siu mai), or some nicely fried spring rolls. Service is also super fast and efficient - just write your order down on the menu, flag down a server, and you'll get your items within minutes. It was all very solid, but not quite as memorable as my first Tim Ho Wan experience in 2011, although in that case waiting around for 90 minutes and getting super hungry as a result may have primed my taste buds quite a bit. With all the Tim Ho Wans popping up all over the place, you shouldn't have to wait too long now.Nevertheless, despite the let-down factor of being good, but not exceptionally mind-blowing like my first visit, it's all still quality dim sum, and I'd bump up an otherwise 4.5 star review to 5 stars from a Yelp perspective. Do come with a good appetite so you can try all the quality, inexpensive offerings here."
Tim Ho Wan,4,"Just like any Kowloon restaurants and cafes, this place is busy. We actually were seated right away and asked if we wanted the Chinese or English order form. I thought it was nice we had options. The service was efficient, but not too attentive (as I said this place was busy). Once we handed the order form the food came out relatively fast. The price was really good, and the food flavourful. Nothing spectacular, but it was delicious. The ambiance was hurried so it's not a place where you can relax and fully enjoy the food, however, as long as you know what you want you can still savour the food and be satisfied."
Tim Ho Wan,3,"im probably the black sheep here but i dont' get the hype for tim ho wan!!i remember coming here about 5 years back when we visited hong kong and thinking, ""thats good dim sum"".  we went back again this year and it just wasn't spectacular.  there are crowds of people waiting outside on the street, unless you get there at opening, you're looking at a minimum of 20 minutes.  you get in to the super cramped restaurant and have to clean your dishes (ugh, my least favorite part of HK) with the very minimal amount of space and napkins they provide and place your orders in ASAP, additional orders will cost additional money (say what??).  the only thing thats ""special"" i'd say, is the pineapple bun char siu bao.  that is pretty good.  i'd def recommend coming because it has michelin stars galore and is a ""must go"" if you viist, but plan your trip wisely.  come early, get that checked off your list, and move along to all the street food that awaits :)"
Tim Ho Wan,5,This dim sum was amazing. I eat dim sum a lot in CA but it is a little different here. The siu mai was so juicy. The chashu pork buns was DELICIOUS. The outside is a little crispy and sweet. The inside is meaty and salty. I ordered it again after trying it the first time. The ha gao skin and anything with the transparent skin are very delicate. They just break apart but still very delicious. The turnip cakes were really yummy too. I loved everything

DON'T DRINK IT! - Too many good dishes to post, but had to choose the baked bun with BBQ pork as my favorite dish! My mom and I looked like pigs eating so much, we had to get to-go boxes too! Eyes are way bigger than our stomach.- Various locations, but this one is located on on Fuk Wing Street and the most popular one as it's one of the cheapest Michelin starred restaurant!- Communal tables, once again! Get used to it. - Must order the pork buns and turnip cake!- All worth it for the price (takes credit card) - fast, good, and popular!"
Tim Ho Wan,5,"I love how this city is bustling with these wonderful Michelin star restaurants....and the great thing is that they are super affordable and food is always sooo yummy!! I thought I knew dim sum until I got a taste of what this place is all about...I am truly enlightened! And omg it's no wonder they are famous for those amazing BBQ pork buns bc these little buns are seriously out of this world! I can probably eat a whole carton and still crave for more. Shu Mai, sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf, cheong fun, hakao were also very very tasty as well. This place opens at 10 am so I suggest getting there right when it opens or you'll be expected to wait. But even then, these Hong Kong restaurants are quite efficient with their seating arrangements bc they'll be filling every seat that is open even if you have to sit among strangers. Getting in and out and is always a breeze. Such an amazing dim sum experience. The only Tim Ho Wan that exists in the US is in NYC. I sure hope that they one day make their way out to LA!!"
Tim Ho Wan,4,"The taste of the dim sum were light and balanced. Nothing was over the top, neither very good or bad. Everything was just done greatly.I the baked BBQ sauce buns were a slight let down for me. I was expecting more. The sticky rice in a leaf is one of my favourite."
Tim Ho Wan,4,My first Michelin star restaurant and I'm happy to have had the experience at Tim Ho Wan. This place was on our list of places to try out while visiting Hong Kong. It is very affordable and comparable to dim sum prices in Boston. The food is definitely more fresh as all the items are softer and less salty compared to the places in the states.
Tim Ho Wan,5,"I've been dreaming about coming back to Tim Ho Wan ever since my first visit to their original location four years ago. All you need to know is it's a one star Michelin rated restaurant at a shockingly affordable price. They've expanded to five locations in Hong Kong!I dropped in on a Saturday during an odd hour (around 5:15pm) hoping to avoid having to wait. Hit the jackpot! I got seated right away. Guess there are pros to traveling solo. The menu is short and sweet: steamed, deep fried, steamed rice, congee, vermicelli (aka. rice rolls) and desserts. Tick what you want off the list and flag down a waitress.I got lucky and ended up chatting with another solo travel that was seated beside me. We ended up sharing several dishes.- Tea ($2 HKD) - they drop off a pot automatically at your table. At least it's a big pot.- Ha jiao ($28 HKD) - they're a bit tinier than normal but good skin and quality shrimp. - Pan-fried turnip cake ($15 HKD) - comes with a side of hot sauce. Cheap but just average. - Baked bun with BBQ pork ($20 HKD) - 100% a must get. You get three of these babies and they're amazing. Flaky, buttery, sweet, umami goodness. This is THE reason to come to THW. - Steamed beancurd skin roll filled with pork & vegetable ($16 HKD) - three tasty stuffed beancurds. I'd get it again.  - Wonton in chili sauce ($24 HKD) - pretty meh. Don't bother getting this one. - Siu mai ($28 HKD) - tiny like the ha jiao but packed with meat and flavour. - Vermicelli roll stuffed with BBQ pork ($23 HKD) - these were actually delicious. I wasn't expecting them to be this good but the texture was fantastic.- Steamed dumpling in chiu chow style ($14 HKD) - these are totally worth the price. You get three pieces and it's stuffed with chopped peanuts, chives, radish, mushroom and dried shrimp/ground pork. Solid. Get the baked bun with BBQ pork! Everything else is bonus."
Tim Ho Wan,5,Great place for dim sum. Michelin Star rated. The pork buns are to die for!  The Shiao Mai is he best I've ever had (the mushrooms make it taste so good)!
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Another not to miss spot in HKG. Small unassuming eatery... crowded, busy and bustling with staff moving ordered dim sum from kitchen to anticipating tables. We lucked out...walked in 40mins after they opened and no wait!! I can't add anymore than what's already been said about this Michelin star dim sum restaurant.  I would like to quote my nephew when he sent pictures of our meal to family. He said,  ""doesn't look terribly different but the quality and taste is unreal"". One note...do not miss the baked char siu bun...order two right away and you'll probably order another!"
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Huge fan of their prices. Huge fan of their har gao--5/5 (shrimp dumplings). Great shu mai--5/5 and lo bo gao--5/5 as well. BBQ pork buns--2/5? eh. maybe just different preferences. This place is as good as the best dim sum in SF, for sure, but not much better. The har gao was certainly my #1, though."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Only 2 words for you: Pork Buns!  Worth the many hours of travelling to Hong Kong.This restaurant is great.  You will not be disappointed and the dim sum prices are very reasonable.The group ate very well on the cheap, food items are tasty, and the service was fast.Thank u for taking the time to read my post of this restaurant."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"My first Michelin star experience. I'm used to eating mediocre dim sum in Toronto, Canada. After eating here, I do not want to eat any dim sum in Toronto again. The rice noodle roll was perfect. The roll was thin and the meat was tender and juicy. Almost every table I saw ordered the baked BBQ pork buns so I followed suit. They were by far the most delicious BBQ pork buns I've ever had. The only food I did not like was the beef ball because it was too salty and rather unique tasting. I came here 3 times in a span of 2 weeks because the food was so good. The wait times were not as bad as I had imagined them to be."
Tim Ho Wan,1,"We read how good this dim sum restaurant was, so we were very disappointed in the dim sum, in fact it was the worst dim sum we ever had.  We ordered the pork and shrimp dim sum, actually shu mai (sp?).  There was no shrimp in it, and the pork was either barely cooked or all fat, we could not tell the difference, and we spit it out, we could not eat it, it was pretty disgusting.  Maybe the other locations are better, but we're not even going to bother trying them while there are so many other excellent dim sum restaurants in Hong Kong."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Life-changing pork buns. Dim sum is great... but the pork buns. The location in Tong Mi is definitely the best. Tried the HK train station one and the food was slightly off.Get there early! It gets crowded, fast. At the Tong Mi location, walk up to the front and put your name down to get a number. They have an English menu as well. Cash only. You can also buy to take out as well."
Tim Ho Wan,3,"Tasty as dim sum should be but quality is average. The restaurant itself, being a tourist trap, is mediocre. The worst part is that the whole yum-cha experience is ruined by the fact that there is no good loose leaf tea at all. So disappointing. I am a local who has always heard of friends and visitors going to tim ho wan but never had the chance to try myself. It was okay, I would go just for thrill of going to a Michelin (or michelin recommended) resto.Other than that, the hao gao - shrimp dumplings - were by far the best of the dim sum. Would also recommend getting chiu chow dumplings, beef balls... and nothing else that I can recall.Given the chance I wouldn't mind coming back but I wouldn't make the trek to SSP solely for it."
Tim Ho Wan,4,"I'll give this a slight edge over Fu Lum - but it's slight. As mentioned in that review, I was excited to try the baked pork buns, and was not let down by the crispier baked crust, something I'd never had until coming here. However, the pork filling, while good, is missing some of the richness and savory flavor of Fu Lum, trending towards sweeter and I think with too much cinnamon flavor. Combine this bun with Fu Lum's pork filling...and we're off to the races.Other items were strong through - shrimp dumplings were good here (as they were pretty much everywhere, honestly) with good tender shrimp and actual shrimp flavor. Beef vermicelli rolls tasted good, but were difficult to eat with my poor chopstick skills - who knew that rice noodles wrapped in rice paper would be a floppy difficult item to eat. As other have noted, this is either the cheapest or nearly the cheapest Michelin rated restaurant. Prices are so cheap that we ordered two of one item thinking it couldn't possibly be more than one of that item...and it ended up being 3 pieces to an order. Whoops. So this is well worth a visit. I love being able to try so many different things without running the bill through the roof."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"I was visiting here from the United States on business and stopped by this place after seeing the reviews. This place was INCREDIBLE! It was a little weird getting seated at a table with other people, but it was still a great experience. There pork buns were by far the best thing on the menu"
Tim Ho Wan,5,"One Michelin Star restaurant is located right in Sham Shui Po ! The Dim Sum here is affordable compared to most places, however the selection is not as much.There will be a lot of people, but the turnover is quite fast. I got in within 30 minutes. Of all the food I have eaten in this restaurant (a good 10 dishes).. I will emphasize one dish in this review.Pineapple Pork Bun. Pineapple Pork Bun. Pineapple Pork Bun.Oops, I said it three times. Because I ate three. Double Oops.Oh laawwwwddddd, it's so scrumptious.  I guarantee you'd want another several plates worth of this golden brown delicacy. So worth, much worth."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Awesome dim sum!First time in Hong Kong, I came here with my american friends. Very impressive food for a reasonable price. We enjoyed all the dishes but the plate of 3 large beef balls were our favorite!"
Tim Ho Wan,4,"When figuring out which restaurants to eat at, my friend mentioned that I absolutely had to try Tim Ho Wan - the cheapest Michelin star restaurant with a number of locations across Hong Kong. My parents, already having tried it once before, didn't think it was worth another visit, but seeing as how I really wanted to go, decided to put it onto our list of restaurants to try in Hong Kong. This particular location is on Fuk Wing Street. There isn't much of a waiting area, so a ton of people just crowd around the entrance waiting for their number to be called. We arrived on a really rainy day and were pretty dismayed to see all the people waiting. Luckily they were all large parties and we waited only about 10 minutes or so. Because the restaurant is so busy and the tables are really cramped, you're not really taking in the ambience or décor - you just want a taste of what all they hype is about. The menu is in Chinese, but if you ask you can get an English version. I was pretty dismayed to find out that a lot of the popular items that people were raving about were not offered at this location of Tim Ho Wan. I really wanted to try their shrimp wrapped in bean curd, but apparently they didn't have it here. We decided to just try a few popular items and then eat elsewhere if we were still hungry. We ended up ordering the normal dishes that are typically ordered during dim sum: Steamed Pork Dumplings (Siu Mai)Shrimp DumplingsShrimp Rice RollRadish CakeThere was nothing special about ^ those three dishes. Very typical dim sum quality that you'd expect to find in SGV. The two items that were really good had to be the beef rice roll and the bbq pork buns. The beef was cooked extremely and had good flavor. Rice roll itself was super smooth and silky, making the entire bite really delicious. And the popular bbq pork buns - they are definitely as good as people say. Normally I am not a fan of the buns topped with a pineapple crust, but the crust definitely added to the overall flavor of the bun, going incredibly well with the bbq pork inside. The meat inside had a good sweet flavor to it and didn't taste dry nor cheaply put together. This was seriously the best bbq pork bun I've ever had and I was sad that it was so small! tl;dr - Definitely a restaurant worth visiting just so you can say you've eaten at a Michelin star restaurant. As for the food - it's not bad, but I think I expected to have my mindblown after hearing so many good things about it. The bbq pork buns were definitely amazing, but everything else was just decent. Seeing as there are so many dim sum restaurants in SGV, you're not missing too much if you don't get the chance to go to HK."
Tim Ho Wan,4,"Those bbq pork buns pretty much make up for the rest otherwise average dishes. I'm not going to lie, this place was marked on my to-eat list ever since I bought my plane tickets to HK. Probably cause I was so hyped about the cheapest in the world Michelin star experience. Anyways, this place opens at 10 (9 on weekends), which I thought was somewhat late for a dim sum spot. Came around 9:35 on a Thursday (my brother and I), and was around the 10th person there. Not too bad at all. There were more people that lined up until opening (probably 30 or so) but everyone was able to be seated during the ""initial wave"". Service is definitely not the ""Hi how are you doing? type"", but rather quick and effective. Tea was served promptly and we submitted our order sheet pretty fast as we looked over it while waiting. Ordered the following: Shrimp Dumplings, Siu Mai, Sticky Rice, Turnip Cake, Beef Ball, Noodle Roll (Shrimp and BBQ Pork), and the BBQ pork buns. Nothing too special about most of the dishes - just a warning the sticky rice is a pretty big portion.....Wish some of the dishes were a bit hotter when served, such as the noodle rolls and shrimp dumplings. But the (Michelin) STAR truly goes to the bbq pork buns. They were so good I had all 3! (true but only because my brother was scared of allergies). The outside of the pastry was crunchy, but soft and warm on the inside. Best part was that it stayed relatively intact even as I devoured those pastries. Most of the dishes range from $15-28 HKD (for Canadians thats $2.5-5). On the whole its a bit pricier than dim sum shops that I've been to, but its won't break your wallet. I would return for the bbq pork buns, but everything else is more of a toss up as they weren't really special. Don't think the wait will be all too bad considering the number of locations of THW present both in Kowloon and on the island."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"My Hong Kong food journey is finally complete!  I finally made it to Tim Ho Wan on my last afternoon in HK.The restaurant is about a short walk from the Shek Kip Mei (green line) MTR station.  There is no English signage over the restaurant, so I had to go by the pictures on Yelp.There was no wait at 2pm.  The tables here are square shaped (I'm used to circular tables at dim sum). So even though we were sharing a table with 2 other pairs of people, there was plenty of space.No ladies pushing carts here, or in any of the HK dim sum restaurants I visited.  You have to order your dishes via a sheet of paper.  There's a Chinese and English version. What we ordered:Shu mei - it was okay, I would pass on it next time as it was just plain ordinary.Pork liver shu mei - Essentially 2large shu mei's without the wrapper and several pieces of pork liver on the side.  It was decent.  The quality actually tasted better than the regular shu mei.Roasted pork buns - I know that Tim Ho Wan is known for these, but I thought they were mediocre.  From the first bite, all I tasted was butter.  The roasted pork filling was bland, almost tasteless.  I would pass on this dish.Dan san (fried egg puffs covered with honey/syrup and sprinkled with sesame). - This was the winner.  The Dan san was crispy, yet soft, very unlike the hard ones I'm used to.Tonic medlar and petal cake - It was very light and refreshing.  It is essentially a gelatin cake that had a taste that is hard to describe, almost floral like.  I would definitely recommend this as I've never seen this dish before. Overall it was a decent meal that was decently priced.  Lots of locals and seniors were dining there."
Tim Ho Wan,1,"If you want less than mediocre dim sum, rude servers, seated with strangers in small tables and tight spaces, this is the place for you.  This place is another joke of a restaurant I visited during my trip to HK.  I couldn't get out of here fast enough.  When I tried to pay with a $1k bill, the rude lady pushed it back to me and pointed to a note (in Chinese) and told me to read it (Don't assume I can read it just because I'm Asian).  I pretty much figured they didn't accept this bill but since she's being a bitch I pushed the money back to her and said ""I don't read Chinese"". She pushed it back again and by this time I had to text my friend to come back in (I didn't have any smaller bills and they do not accept credit cards). I walked away letting her know they have the worst service ever.  Never coming back."
Tim Ho Wan,4,"As you walk in, the restaurant is small and cramped.  Tables are almost side to side by each other with some wall space in between. There's also private room dining spaces upstairs but at an upcharge. Coming from the states, I didn't let that bother me as I was here for the Michelin star dimsum.My main faves were the baked cha siu baos and cheurng fun. The cha siu baos were amazing! The top crust was nice, buttery, and crisp. The pork inside was semi sweet and juicy. Their cheurng fun rolls were delicious as well! The noodle was so delicate and smooth. So fresh! Ordered multiple other items and they were all fairly good. Left satisfied and this was my second time around stopping by Tim Ho Wan! Give it a try if you're in Hong Kong!"
Tim Ho Wan,1,"There is one golden rule something people needs to be aware of in Hong Kong dining scene.  If you dine at a place serve excellent food, the services will be crap!  That is exactly what Tim Ho Wan is!The quality and execution of their food are excellent to superb, but their services is not acceptable at all!   Usually the one will give you the attitudes are either the hostess or the cashier, and they're usually related to the family who operate the business.For that, I am glad to have tried it, but I will never go back again.   Food and services are equally as important, as far as I am concerned.   If you don't care about the services at all or even being yelled at by the servers/cashiers, then you will love it.  In that case, order the crispy crust BBQ pork bun or the Chiu Chow dumplings."
Tim Ho Wan,3,"Do I include hype and expectations in this review? It's hard not to. I was recommended this place by no less than four people. Plus, there's the whole 'cheapest Michelin starred restaurant' thing. And the line out the door on a Monday at 1pm thing.I think it's a good thing I didn't go to the location on the island. I went to the one in the ugly industrial area of Kowloon. And being a single diner, I was seated within five minutes... at an intimately tiny table with an older lady who spoke no English and who made a game out of totally avoiding my eyes and pretending I didn't exist, even when I tried to pour her tea.That is, until my BBQ pork buns arrived, at which point she was suddenly curious. She caught my eye and pointed to the tray of buns, giving me a quizzical thumbs up. The lady at the next table tried to translate. ""You tasty?"" she asked.I was tasty. The buns were that style we see less often abroad... the flatter fried style with the sugar crust on top. Usually with a bun like this I assume dessert. And with the sweetness level of this thing... that's not too far off. It was perfect texture wise, so flaky it fell apart under my chopsticks and I had to use my hands, something I'm sure my tablemate noted disapprovingly, and the pork and sauce were tasty, but man, that bready sugar coating... I wished I'd sugar-fasted before coming here so I could have enjoyed it more.My shrimp dumplings were vastly more enjoyable for me, if with less detail to describe. It was just a perfectly executed dumpling, with the skin unobtrusively melting away after it had served its purpose, leaving just the slippery, springy shrimp and its fresh flavor behind."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"A GAJILLION STARS for this Michelin Dim Sum place in Hong Kong. Definitely worth the long wait! I pretty much go for dim sum once a week since I was born cause my dad loves it so much. Well now a lot less, maybe like once every two to three weeks after learning how unhealthy it is. It's kind of the same dim sum over and over again here and there and I'm no longer a huge fan of dim sum anymore. BUT, NI HAO TIM HO WAN. This is probably the best dim sum I have ever had; it's innovative, yet delicious. The dim sum you order are served on cute little plates. My favourite is probably their baked bun with BBQ pork on the inside. The flakey, soft, slightly crisp shell on top of the bun, nice and hot center with that oh so good BBQ pork on the inside. First bite, SCRUMPTIOUS. CAN I HAVE TEN MORE PLEASE?!For a Michelin restaurant, this place is affordable. And the menu?! It's nice and clear with Chinese and English - friendly for tourists!"
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Amazing place. We came here w 6 ppl.Ordered a lot, maybe more than 10 dishes. Cost only $7 per person"
Tim Ho Wan,1,"For it to be a Michelin Star and everything recommended by people, uh.... I expected a hell a lot more from them. The menu is small, the place is small, and the wait was fair for a party of two. The price is overpriced for it to be Hong Kong and the food being mediocre. Cash only! I think I could have went somewhere else for the same quality, cheaper and probably lesser waiting time. Since they just opened up a location in Irvine, California, I'm really interested in seeing how they are out here."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"The famous one Michelin star dim sum restaurant that everyone told me I must go... I wasn't planning on it initially because I don't like waiting in line for hours, but my SIL said I shouldn't miss it.  So our group went to line up at 8:20am on a Sunday (they open at 9:00am) and imagine my surprise when we were the first group there! Although the restaurant wasn't open yet, they let us sit in the waiting area and we had our dim sum sheets all marked up.  By the time it was 8:40am or so there was a huge crowd, overhearing some people saying they come every week.  I simply couldn't wait!While the variety is not as big as other dim sum restaurants, they do dishes very well here.  Everything we ordered was tasty and we even had second... and third rounds.  Delicious food with a very reasonable price tag, what more can you ask for? Our group of eight stuffed our bellies full for a mere $510HKD.  That's pretty darn good."
Tim Ho Wan,5,Just make sure you check this spot off your list for dim sum. We ordered so many thing for two people and it was about $20 Usd. In Cali we are lucky if we pay $50 for two people. If you get there before 11 you won't have to wait that long. HK people are not awake yet so you can get a seat pretty quickly.
Tim Ho Wan,4,"My friends and I decided that we had to check out one of the locations of Tim Ho Wan while visiting Hong Kong since it received a Michelin Star.  We compared the menus of several locations before picking one and found that the pricing was different at different locations.  Also some dishes are unique to certain locations.  This location offered the pumpkin soup with tapioca for dessert.  Soup had a smooth texture and had a steady pumpkin flavor with the right level of sweetness.  Tapioca was soft and practically melted in my mouth.  The vermicelli noodle roll skin was thinner and more delicate than ones I had in the US before.  The sweet soy sauce that was over the rolls was less sweet here and less was served with each dish.  Chicken feet were marinated in a sauce that was less sweet compared to ones I had before.  Sesame shrimp rolls had a nice crisp outside with flavorful shrimp inside.  The seasonal vegetable turned out to be iceberg lettuce, so I would skip that.  The meat over steamed rice dishes were also very good and the meat was packed with flavor.  Each was large enough to be a whole meal by itself.  You don't get your own plate to put food on to, but you do get a small bowl, spoon and chopsticks.  We ended up using some of the dishes from the courses as our own.  Service was good.  Wasn't my favorite dim sum experience in Hong Kong, but worth checking out."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Absolutely lives up to its standing as the cheapest Michelin starred restaurant in the world. Best dim sum I've ever had. Everything from the dumplings to their signature pork buns was delicious and came out quickly. The ordering system is very efficient and simple as it's just a form where you circle what you want (in English too). The sponge cake was a brilliant surprise, so moist and fluffy. The wet dumpling strips in soy sauce were really tasty and something you don't see in the US. Just wish they had some more beverages. There was surprisingly no wait when I came on a midday during the week, so I guess I was lucky. I also loved that it was all locals eating there, always a good sign. The price makes it an excellent value, far worse quality dim sum back home in the US is so much more expensive. Eating at a Tim Ho Wan is a must if you come to Hong Kong. Now to see if it's as good as Din Tai Fung..."
Tim Ho Wan,4,This place wasn't so bad. But it wasn't very clean inside. I went to a dim sum resto the next day and I could clearly taste the difference in that THW was just average dimsum. The pineapple bbq buns were nice as the reviews recommended.
Tim Ho Wan,4,"This Michelin star dim sum restaurant is very affordable and very busy.  I chose to come to this location since it was the nearest restaurant where I was staying in Kowloon.  Since I was a lone diner I was seated immediately and shared a table with another single diner.   They didn't speak much English but had a English menu.  I had the Phoenix talons in abalone sauce, char siu bao and har gow.  The chicken feet was tasty but I didn't taste abalone.  The char siu bao bun is similar to the custard bun, just filled with char siu and har gow was perfect with right bounce to it when bitten into.  I spent a total $64 HKD or $8.25 USD.  It was just myself so I didn't order much and didn't want to hold onto leftovers while sightseeing in hot humid weather. I will definitely be back when I am in town."
Tim Ho Wan,4,"I came solo on a Thursday morning right after they open so I didn't have to wait.  They use up every single seat they have inside the restaurant so if you dine alone, be prepared to sit with people you don't know.  I sat with a family of 3.  The husband and wife were so nice.  They helped me order food in Chinese too.  I ordered baked BBQ pork bun, shrimp ha jiao, and chicken feet.  I absolute love the baked BBQ bun!!  They are well known for it.  It's a combination of sweet and savory.  Savory BBQ pork inside, sprinkle sugar on the outside.  Ha jiao and chicken feet were standard, just like other places where I have had dim sum: Vancouver, NYC, SF, LA, Seattle, China, VN.  They didn't make the food anything special to make you remember. The food was good and tasty in general.  It's not a bad dim sum place.  Not expensive.  I think I would come back if I don't have any other better options available."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"I was hesitant about trying this place because usually highly-rated places or anywhere with an award/ recognition of some kind is only mediocre and overrated. 5 stars is under-rating this place. Everything is so fresh, both the ingredients as well as the flavor. Those who don't like dimsum because it's too greasy, give Tim Ho Wan a shot. This place serves the best dimsum I've ever had! Details:BBQ Pork Bun: 5/5 best char siu bao I've ever had and I normally don't like char siu bao. The pork is juicy and tasty and the pineapple bun has a slight sweetness to balance out the pork.Har Gao: 5/5 I've never been more obsessed with the dumpling skin! You can definitely tell it was freshly wrapped and not frozen the night before; it was thin enough so it doesn't steal the spotlight from the shrimp filling and it had the right amount of elasticity. And of course the shrimp was very fresh and flavorful. Shu Mai: 5/5 normally not a huge shu mai fan but I always must try it because it is dimsum after all. The pork and shrimp was so tasty and the wonton skin was just as great.Shrimp/Beef/CharSiu Rice Noodle Rolls: 5/5 the cheurng funs are soooooooo damn smooth!!! I fell in love from first bite. Regardless of whether you're a beef or shrimp lover, get both because they're equally as amazing. I cannot stop raving about this place; this place exceeds expectations and I now understand why this place is a Michelin star restaurant."
Tim Ho Wan,4,"If I could visit HK again, this is definitely a place I would come back. Why? It's the baked BBQ pork buns. I don't know why, but I'm currently salivating for those tasty, flaky, crisp buns that are generously filled up with sweet / BBQ flavored pork. I haven't had buns like these before in the States and to me, that alone is worth the trip here.Tim Ho Wan is a highly popular dim sum place (with multiple locations) and reservations are suggested to avoid the long queue. Came here with a few friends during my HK visit and thankfully, we were able to get a reservation in during the off hours / non peak eating times.When seated, do note that there is some type of ritual/process in washing your cups and utensils. Another neat thing about this place is that most of the dim sum items are included in the visual menu that is conveniently placed onto the table itself. For ordering, you just list what you want to eat on the order sheet, and your food will be brought to you.Overall, dim sum here is yummy. Portion sizes are decent and quality is fresh and hot. Like most dim sum places, you'll see the usual options offered but the one thing that stood out the most to me was definitely the pork buns. Service is quick and if you really need something, simply wave your arms about and someone will attend to you shortly. Prices are decent (especially if you're in a group) so bring cash with you to help split the bill easier!"
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Where in the world can you sit elbow-to-elbow with strangers speaking dozens of different languages while chowing down on Michelin-starred food for less than $10? That's Tim Ho Wan -- the Hong Kong-based dim sum chain famously called the world's most affordable Michelin-star restaurant.To get a seat in the packed restaurant, diners have to take a number at the desk out front and wait patiently to be called. I rolled up optimistically hoping there wouldn't be a crowd, but, well. There was. As I waited for my number to be called, I realized that I maybe should have studied some Cantonese numbers. Luckily, I was dining alone, so the hostess quickly plucked me from the crowd and led me inside to fill an empty chair at one of the bustling tables.I sat at a table where five other people were already dining, their delicious-looking plates covering the cramped space as I perused my menu. An elderly woman sat across from me, eyeing me skeptically as I did things incorrectly (man, I think you're supposed to rinse off your plates and chopsticks with tea before the meal, but nobody told me what to do?!) and tried to help me use the correct utensils.After using a pencil to check items off the green paper menu, the food begins piling up quickly.First to arrive was my vermicelli roll stuffed with beef ($21 HKD, or about $2.70 USD). Seasoned soy sauce is poured over the dish as soon as it's placed on the table. These three rolls were super delicious -- especially the two on the bottom that were able to soak more of the soy sauce into their rice noodle wrappings. The perfect tenderness and consistency, but I might have liked a little more beef flavor.As I was finishing up these rolls, my steamed egg cake ($16 HKD) arrived. Y'all, this was so amazingly good. I was definitely expecting something that more closely resembled egg, but when a tasty, sugary sponge cake appeared, I was not mad about it. It was so light and fluffy with a tantalizing brown sugar kind of flavor. I loved this and could have eaten 20 of them.The Tim Ho Wan menu items I'd heard the most about were the baked buns with barbeque pork ($20 HKD for three buns), so I obviously had to try them out. These char siu bao did not disappoint! The three buns were served encased in perfectly-cooked, flaky breading. Slightly sweet and crunchy on the outside, but chewy and meaty on the inside. I think I could eat 20 of these as well. The texture is absolute perfection and the flavors blend together so well. These are Tim Ho Wan's signature dish for good reason.Finally, I ended the meal with some steamed pork dumplings with shrimp ($27 HKD). I used to eat a lot of microwave shrimp siu mai from Trader Joe's, but it's an honor to get to try the real deal. These were great (what else did you expect?), packed with shrimp filling and bursting with flavor. Hot and juicy, and the perfect way to top off a great meal.After the four small plates, I was feeling pretty stuffed, but so happy that I was able to taste these excellent dishes. It's worth the wait, it's worth the trip to Hong Kong -- Tim Ho Wan is a fantastic dim sum experience."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"This has one of the best dimsum I've ever had in my life! Compared to the other places I've had dimsum in HK on my trip and places on the East Coast, this is not an exaggeration. This establishment definitely isn't overhyped with its famed reputation.I'm not sure how big the other locations in HK were but this location was fairly small. There was three of us and the wait wasn't too long -- about 20 mins or so? Their menu is in all Chinese and you mark down how many you want next to each dish's name. I'm not sure if they had an English menu or not but we came hungry so we got one of everything. They were probably wondering if we were crazy to order 23 dishes between three people :). Their service is of a no-nonsense variety and the food came out really quickly. Once you're done eating, you leave so that's probably why the wait wasn't as long as I thought. The dimsum all tasted fresh and didn't taste like they were heated back up from the day before. If I get to come back to HK again, I am definitely coming back!!"
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Hong Kong Dim Sum is everything!This outpost is easy to miss while walking from the Prince Edward station, so just make sure you're really on the lookout. I ate here with one other person and we ordered 11 items out of sheer excitement...we're pigs I know haha! We probably could have gotten away with just one order each of the Sui Mai and Har Gow but when you're in HK, you gotta go all in. These two are staples of any good dims sum establishment and they did not disappoint here. The wrappers on both were so thin and not chewy at all, which is a problem I often find back in America. The fillings were so much more flavorful too, probably because the meat and seafood they use is much fresher than what people use at home. The upgrade in flavor is undeniable. I also loved the Radish Cake! Sooo soft. Ugh, just writing about it makes me wish I could go back...apparently they will open up a NYC location sometime soon so I can't wait to try!"
Tim Ho Wan,4,"It this place worth the hype? I would say so. Coming from the States and reading a ton of restaurant blogs for HK, I knew that if I had the change, I should visit a Tim Ho Wan for their dim sum. Is everything UHHH-mazing? No... But there are a handful that were way better than the dishes I've had in the States. So his location in Sham Shui Po opens at 10am on the weekdays and 9am on the weekends so try to get there early. We waited for about 15 minutes for our table so the wait is not bad at all. Just try to stay in the shade if you plan on coming in the summer so you don't bake in the sun.The service is quick so once you sit, clean your utensils, your dishes should start coming out. We pretty much ordered everything on the sheet but the highlights were the shrimp dumplings, the sponge cake, and the pork kidney (or liver) shu mai.  For the shrimp dumplings, the wrapper was very thin but strong enough to hold the filling. The filling itself felt like it was had the right amount of seasoning with the right amount of salt. The sponge cake (Ma Lai Gou) was super fluffy. It was like a fresh Krispy Kreme donut that was fresh out of the fryer where it feels like you are biting into a cloud. I feel like I have never had a lighter sponge cake. It also had the perfect amount of brown sugar so it wasn't overly sweet. It was so good, we ordered a second serving. Finally, the pork kidney shu mai. I ordered this by accident because I suck at reading Chinese but it turned out good. I didn't eat the pork kidney cuz I'm not that adventurous but I felt the actual shu mai was better than the regular shrimp shu mai. It was more flavorful and felt like I was biting into chunks of meat.Some additional tips to making this a great experience:1. Come early and rush to the podium to get a number and start looking over the menu. It's all in Chinese so be sure you are ordering the right dish.2. Don't bring too much stuff with you because the tables are very close together. Like literally, my friend and I were pretty much sharing tables with the table next to us.3. Start off with a handful of orders and then keep adding. The dishes come out pretty quickly so don't be worried that ordering later will make you wait and wait for the latter orders to come out.4. When in doubt, order the dishes that they are known for: BBQ Pork Bun and the Sponge Cake.5. Come to this location as I hear this location is the original and is better and less crowded than the one in Central or Tseung Kwan O (or others that I am not aware of)"
Tim Ho Wan,5,"I don't know who Tim is or what he looks like, but I'm pretty sure I'd love him forever anyway.Famous for being the cheapest Michelin star restaurant in the world, score you some seriously AMAZING eats in this low key joint for dirt cheap. Seriously, I got 4 dim sum items (flaky pastry barbecue pork buns, turnip cake, phoenix talon, and shrimp dumplings) for $80HKD. ....$80 HKD. That's like, $10 USD, guys. For steamed-to-order, high quality, DELICIOUS dim sum. Plump juicy shrimp and lightly caramelized pastry for your barbecue buns? I mean, why aren't you over there already? If you come solo (like me), you will get sat quickly, likely sharing a table with someone. Smile and greet them- it's weird if you stare at them across the table and don't.Expect a serious wait on the weekends, and be patient when you order your food! It takes a long time to receive your food, but I promise that it'll all be worth it!"
Tim Ho Wan,5,What a great restaurant.  Every dish was a better rendition of classic Dim Sum dishes than I've had elsewhere.  This was especially true of the Baked barbecue pork buns.  The only dish I was mixed on was the sautéed vegetable.  This is a place you should go to.
Tim Ho Wan,4,"Yum to the yum to the infinite degree!!  As everyone stated, there is a long line to this place.  Go early b4 the place opens.  Most likely there will be a line already.  Order 2 orders of the baked bbq buns.  They r really that good.  The bread is light, airy and fluffy at the same time.   The bbq inside has the right amount meat and salty and sweetness.  The malay steamed cake was really good too.  They really use molasses to make it.  As a result,  u have dark, soft lightly sweetened cake.  The other dim sums were only ok.  I've had better elsewhere.  I would definitely go back for the bbq buns and malay go..."
Tim Ho Wan,4,"You don't come here for the service you come for the food! Best dim sum ever. If you want to walk right in and skip the wait show up after 1pm. I ate here twice during my visit and also at the Olympic location. This one seems much more like locals than the other. Everything is so cheap here that you can get a ton of food even if you don't eat it all. It's worth trying. Of course they are most famous for the BBQ pork buns, so make that a first on your list. My other favoritesolp are the aged pork congee, crispy spring rolls, egg cake, and shrimp dumplings. Honestly though nothing here is bad. If it's your first time here don't expect amazing service. Once seated you have to mark your card with your order and wave it in the air till someone grabs it. You'll pay at the front counter when done. Tim Ho Wan is just epically delicious and so so cheap. Our end bill for 6 dishes and two waters was $17 USD. Thank goodness we have one in NYC now because i'm addicted."
Tim Ho Wan,5,Rather simple meal The dim sum was a fun experience and the decor is simple and nothing fancy
Tim Ho Wan,5,Excellent dim sum place at an affordable price. Every item was delicious but the star is definitely the Baked BBQ pork bun. Space is tight and service is almost non-existent. We came on a weekday around 11am and waited about 15 mins for a table so not bad. The food comes very quickly so pace yourself when ordering. English menu available. Our bill came out to around HKD 180 for 2 adults and 1 toddler.
Tim Ho Wan,5,"An incredible value for delicious food!I arrived before 11:00 in the morning, and while I didn't have to wait, I was seated at a table with three others, and there were already larger groups waiting outside.  The staff were all very busy and working hard to keep throughput high.The baked BBQ pork buns and steamed egg cake were ridiculous.  I had some trouble eating the steamed sparerib due to the amount of gristle and bone left with the meat, but this is regional and not specific to the establishment.  Needless to say, I was extremely full after leaving here.  The unlimited pu-erh is a nice touch, although they do charge a few HK$ per seat.I overheard a local at my table saying that what makes Tim Ho Wan special is that they don't screw anything up.  Even the sticky rice is a detail that some restaurants miss, but not Tim Ho Wan."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"By far the best dim sum experience I've ever had. Service is... well... very Hong Kong, meaning all business.Food... amazing. Got the baked bao, liver vermicelli, soy noodles, and a bunch more. All of it was amazing.Cheapest Michelin Star restaurant... haha"
Tim Ho Wan,3,"Tim Ho Wan is a decent dim sum restaurant. I do believe it is way over-hyped. We had the standard dishes such as feng zhao, siu mai, har gow, lo mai gai. Overall, I was expecting these dishes to be superior to the ones in America. However, most tasted normal despite its Michelin status. The menu is also bare bones, so I didn't see any bolo baos or options to get different teas. That said, I did enjoy the freshly made char siu bao. That was amazing and hands down the main attraction by the locals and tourists such as myself. The food was cheap and I guess I can't complain as our total bill came to roughly $20 USD for a party of 2."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"I think this is the cheapest michelin star restaurant in the world, and the best dim sum I have ever eaten. The place is small and crowded. Come early and expect a wait. And be prepared to share a table with strangers (a common practice in smaller HK restaurants). Don't worry, you don't share your food with strangers. You eat what you order. Must orders are the rice rolls (cheung fun) and the bbq pork bun. The rice wrappers are thin enough to be translucent to see the filling, and silky smooth. And the bbq pork bun is slightly crispy on the outside, and light and fluffy on the inside. They also have the old-school vintage shau mai made with pork liver. Of course, they have the normal version for the less adventurous as well. They also have other dim sum dishes, such as shrimp dumpling (har gow) and chicken feet, and several rice dishes. One thing about this place is that they still use traditional bamboo steamers, as oppose to plastic or metal steamers. Bamboo steamers make a big difference as it keeps the temperature and moisture consistent. For dessert, don't forget to get the osmanthus gogi berry jello. The osmanthus is so refreshing with a slight sweetness for the gogi berry. A great end to a delicious meal. Once you're done, you bring your check up to the counter by the door to pay. A 10% service charge is already included  (a standard in HK)."
Tim Ho Wan,3,All of the food was fine but nothing was really that delicious besides the BBQ Pork Buns. Those were definitely the standout and they were great. Everything else was pretty run-of-the-mill; I wasn't impressed at all.
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Amazing melt in your mouth bbq pork pineapple buns! They use to give it as a complimentary dish, but now you actually have to order it. Its super worth it tho! I ate 2 orders myself and it came in 3's. HK Dim sum is not comparable to SF Dim Sum. Asia has it best when you talk about good food! I ordered multiple dishes for a party of 8 or 9. The bill came out to be only 500 hkg. So it was not bad at all! If you want to experience delicious dim sum and your in hong kong...make your way down here! They serve dim sum from morning to night. Sadly it is not the dim sum cart way of ordering. Plus side for those that do not read chinese characters, they have a english menu too!"
Tim Ho Wan,5,"little bit loudy and crowdy with long queue...but once tried, would know absolutely worth waiting. the cheapest michelin star restaurant ever tried."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"Best damn dimsum I've ever had. In my entire life. Seriously, I came back to the states and had dimsum and felt seriously disappointed/sad. It just won't ever be the same again. The shrimp dumplings here were the star for my table. We got 4 orders. Just writing those words are making me crave more right now. The pork buns are also AMAZING. They are like a pineapple bun with pork filling inside. PERFECT. One of my other favorite items- the short ribs. The sauce for the ribs is like the best I've ever had. We definitely overate here but we literally had to try everything on the menu. We did two rounds, after thinking one round would be enough. For being a Michelin Star restaurant, it's extremely affordable. I can't wait to go back. PS- going on a weekday (tuesday) we experienced no wait. This is probably quite unusual for this place. A local did recommend we go but told us to expect a wait, probably at least an hour."
Tim Ho Wan,5,"OMFG this is so good.I can't find the words to convey how much I enjoyed Tim Ho Wan. It's unbelievably delicious and the small prices are a breath of fresh air in a city where expensive restaurants are plentiful.We ate like kings for 170 HKD and had to be carried out.The restaurant itself is not the nicest, the service is nothing to write home about, the process is a bit difficult to figure out without any help, but none of that made a dent in the pleasure I had eating there.We just left the restaurant and I'm already considering going back for dinner. It's 10x better than other more expensive restaurants in Hong Kong."
Tim Ho Wan,3,"Having zero experience with Michelin star dining, I have only to go by the commonly held impressions of it being a sign of extremely excellent fine dining and culinary finesse. International chefs boast about their stars and have been known to cry over losing them, after all. However, the shameless casualness of Tim Ho Wan, supposedly the world's cheapest one Michelin starred restaurant, may make you rethink such impressions.Tim Ho Wan has many locations in HK, including this one in the edge of impoverished Sham Shui Po. Hype reeks right in the storefront. If it wasn't for the awaiting crowd outside and the Michelin recommended decals on the window, this might as well be your average dim sum restaurant in Hong Kong or anywhere else in the world.You can request an English menu/order sheet to read while waiting for a table, though their tables comes with placemats with pictures featuring some popular items. The popularity of this place means your party will likely be sharing a table with complete strangers. You will be given a large bowl, which is for you to clean your utensils and dishes with the big pot of tea (practically formalizing a practice many Asian diners do before eating). Service is a bit Asian-typical no-nonsense and quick-quick, to the point you may benefit from a mistake like we did with an extra order of siu mai plopped on our table. Shhhhh, don't say anything; wipe that confused look off your face!The food though generally didn't blow me away. It was as average as many good dim sum I have had elsewhere. Many people are head over heels for their specialty crispy barbeque pork buns. It looks quite like but smaller than a McCain's Pizza Pocket (only Canadians would know what that is), and the nicely crispy baked bun shell makes eating this pork bun interesting. But I was not flying off my seat with each bite; I actually find the small size and how it is not stuffed full of meat disappointing.Tim Ho Wan is quite more overly hyped than it deserves; judging from other reviews here people are coming in pre-impressed based on the reputation established by an international ranking run by a rubber tire company, wanting to want everything to be great. As a dim sum diner, it is mostly average an experience; as a restaurant with a Michelin star, it is hilarious and casual. Where else can you spend so little and still claim to your foodie friends you ate at a Michelin recommended restaurant? It's like earning a Yelp badge. Great, but I don't care much for the hype of Michelin star-land; I'm off to collect some real Pokemon badges now."
Tim Ho Wan,4,"Michelin 1 star restaurant for half the price of the Michelin star restaurant price. We came here for Dim Sum. I mean that is basically what they only serve. So we ordered a few things like the xiu mai, sticky rice, some dumplings and bean curb wrapped in pork. So I have to say the food was really good. I am amazed.Decor of the restaurant is not like number 1. But its ok. I think they are famous for the BBQ pork bun. We failed and didn't order that. I see every table ordering it. Well overall dim sum is fresh. Service is good and fair. There are quite a lot of servers working here."
Tim Ho Wan,4,"Came to HK mid april after a week in Korea. Been wanting to return to HK after having been since 2006. Tim Ho Wan was known to be a popular place due to it being a michelin star but affordable dim sum restaurant. Came here on a Monday morning expecting a wait of a sort. We were almost immediately sat at a table. Only delay was the waitress was not at the podium. Me being a stubborn head, i refused to ask for an english menu. Lol so i forced as much chinese character reading out of myself and referred to yelp for a picture Lol xDEverything is made to order. Which has its pros and cons. Pros is that its extremely fresh made and hot. Cons is usually its a limited menu and you dont get to see and over order XD Steamed fresh shrimp dumpling (Ha Gao) - Transparent skin with multiple shrimps inside. Fresh amazingly seasoned shrimp. Steamed pork dumplings with shrimp (Siu Mai) - In the states, this particular dumpling is majority pork. If not all pork. So usually kind of stiff in texture. This one was like half pork and a whole shrimp on the bottom. What a surprise ! I, myself, dont mind seafood and it was a nice surprise for me. One of my friends don't particularly like seafood, so he had a weird surprise. He didn't particularly not like it but didn't like it either. Glutinous rice dumpling (Loh Mai Gai) - In the states, one order comes with usually 2, maybe 3. At THW, it is 1. Big one. Shared among the three. Good flavor. Good size. One of my favorite dim sum items usually. Steamed chicken feet with black bean sauce (Fong Jiao) - Not many people like to eat this but i like it. So i decided to get it, even though one of my friends dont particularly like it, but will still eat it, and the other wont even dream of touching it. Nicely flavored. Not overcooked. The skin isnt mushy and kept its firmness and form. More popular with the older generation and some of the newer gen. acquired taste. not for the white-washed XD BBQ Rice Noodle - Baked bun with BBQ Pork (Cha Siu Bao) - Out of all the items, this is definitely one of my top favs. Different bun style than what im used to in the states. Usually a baked style with a thin honey glaze on top. Here its a bun where its borderline flakey but not flakey. And has a nice ""craquelin"" top similar to pineapple bun. Color of the bun is borderline white. Very surprising and yummy. Filling was flavorful and not overly sweet or salty.  Deep fried dumpling filled with pork (Ham Sui Gok) - Super fresh. Hot out of the fryer. Totally almost burned my mouth eating this. Not your typical fried item if you haven't had dim sum. The outside shell is more like deep fried mochi texture where it has a thin layer of crisp on the outside but its chewy too. Filling inside is not sweet, but savory. Pork and other ingredients. Popular item to order within my family. Vermicelli roll stuffed with BBQ Pork - Standard rice roll with stuffed ingredients. The noodle itself was nicely prepared. thick enough to hold but thin enough to be not too much. price overall was amazing. believe it was less than $20 USD. especially on the HKD to USD conversion. Rates are overall very stable for HKD from USD at on average 7.75 for the past many years. good place to try if you in town !"
Tim Ho Wan,3,"I had to try the world famous Tim Ho Wan in HK.  They are opening one in NYC at the time I wrote this.  Anyways, Tim Ho Wan is easy to get to since I was in TST station.  Lots of hype.  Did THW meet my expectations?  The pork buns with the crispy top was the highlight of my meal.  It is a tad sweet but I enjoyed the pork with the sweet sauce and the sugary crust. Also very genius.  pineapple bun crust with BBQ pork filling?  Hell yeah.  My dim sum staples (shrimp dumpling and siu mei) were a bit disappointed.  Coming from the states, I admit I have American taste buds and I was hoping for more in their shrimp dumpling/siu mei.  The sticky rice was decent.  Nothing that blew me away. Cheapest Michelin star restaurant.  So you have to go here when you visit HK.  I thought it was an average experience.  The BBQ pork buns are really tasty but the rest did not wow me."
Tim Ho Wan,3,"O-v-e-r-r-a-t-e-d.  Hyped in every guidebook in every language.  Lots of dimsum rookies, map in hand, wander in.  Pork buns pretty good - but otherwise ordinary food and limited menu."
Tim Ho Wan,2,"IFC mall for Tim Ho Wan. Place is a magnet for travelers arriving from the airport or MTR. Always expect a line outside but it loves along quickly. There's also a take out area at the register. This is CASH ONLY. Food is selected from a paper menu while you stand and wait on line. Once you sit, they serve the food you selected. This is a eat and go place so don't plan to sit there forever. Dim sum is dim sum but we noticed the quality has gone down the drain. Their famous crispy roast pork buns have become too saucey and salty. It used to be sweet and savory but now the bun is bland and the filling is overwhelmingly salty. Chicken feet is also bland. The plain rice rolls were very bland and soggy. Also ordered the shrimp rice rolls. Shrimps just a year ago were whole but today they were chopped pieces stuffed in a teaspoon dollop. Dumplings and glutinous rice were subpar. It lacks taste instead they were too oily. This is the last time we step foot in this branch."
One Dim Sum,5,"This was my first bite to eat in Hong Kong, except maybe the red bean bun that my friend Lily bought me. This place is a lot more amazing to me than I realized at the time: evening dim sum is something I have never encountered in my years of living, but I also never have lived in Hong Kong. The dim sum offerings are great, I found all my staple favorites, and more.The food here is good, I was not disappointed one bit. Siumai is my must-have at dim sum. The siumai was good and I'm not sure what the little beads are on it but it was delicious. Hargow was good too, another staple that did not disappoint. Radish cake was good, though we were confused about our sauce situation. Rice rolls were yummy, we got it with dried shrimp. Oh boy, though, the glutinous rice dumplings with pork-- I did not realize how much I love them. I've had them before at dim sum but this was the moment that made me mindful of that fact. Glutinous dumplings were deliciously chewy. Oof. I will remember to seek them out during my future dim sum adventures.Notes: They will serve you tea and it's not free; expect to pay 6 HKD a person for tea. They speak English here which is great for foreigners like myself. Cash only, like much of Hong Kong."
One Dim Sum,4,"Great place. Expect a wait around lunch, and into the early afternoon, but worth it. They want you to order fast so take the wait time to get your order ""in order"" LOL. I'm a fan of the flaky type of BBQ pork buns at Tim Ho Wan and these were more of a bread bun that were great in a different way. I might have changed teams for it! Although I do prefer the THW turnip cakes. We ordered a lot for 3 people (pics attached) and everything came out quickly and with flavour. There isn't anything I wouldn't recommend. Service wise they were alright, kind even though a bit cold. But mostly a long wait, and a bit of a rush. Only reason to go down a star, and I did find the rice rolls heavy on the rice and not so much on the other stuff. But still delicious. Oh also we had to share our table which is alright but if you aren't used to it can be awkward."
One Dim Sum,4,"I went here for dinner..i ordered bbq pork bun, cha liong, and sheu mai, and ha kau..taste was good..price were also reasonable..CONCLUSION = RECOMMENDED!!!"
One Dim Sum,5,"When in China, you gotta get dim sum! They accommodated our group of 15 fairly quickly and sat us separately in a private room. You order on the sheet by marking the quantity of orders you'd like next to the name/number of the dish. Our food was the last to come out among our group, but it was well worth the wait. Everything we had was so fresh, hot, steaming, and delicious. We ordered too many things to go into detail, but trust your gut on this one - whatever looks good, get it. The servers don't hesitate to clean up your table as soon as you show signs of being done, so don't expect to stay too long here haha"
One Dim Sum,4,"OMG!!! DIM SUM!!!This small little restaurant gets crazy packed and if you go near lunch time, expect the wait to be at least 1 hour or more long. The wait during the dinner hour is worst, however, I was craving this at 10pm yet surprisingly the restaurant was still full of patrons. I came here for dim sum of course. On this particular night, I ordered take out. The cashier was super helpful and handed me a menu and told me to take my time ordering and return it whenever I was done. Super cool. I seriously was in heaven. I flipped through the menu and literally marked one of everything. I was in the mood to eat for sure. Let's break this down, most of the dim sum dishes tasted delicious and fresh. Portions were moderate but plenty for a party of 2. My most favorite were the siu mai, sticky rice, and  if you're feeling adventurous, I would recommend the chicken feet! It's quite flavorful. I was disappointed that they had ran out of the doughnut wrapped in the rice paper. Overall, the food was great and I definitely got my money's worth. Staff was friendly and welcoming. I definitely would come back my next time in Hong Kong."
One Dim Sum,5,"Another decently priced Michelin starred dim sum place - why i love Asia so much.One dim sum was some of the best dim sum I've had. i went around lunch time and the line was superrrrrr long. Since i was alone, i think i waited about 30 minutes, but I'm sure bigger parties waited much longer.A lot of people are comparing this to Tim Ho Wan. i found them pretty similar. Tim Ho wins on its BBQ buns- their bread is more crispy like pineapple buns, One dim sum has a more soft and baked type of bread. BUT One Dim Sum wins on those mango coconut rolls- super delicious and not crazy sweet, which i like."
One Dim Sum,5,"Easily one of the best dim sum places I've ever eaten at. One Dim Sum is reasonably priced, has a Michelin star, and had no wait before noon on a weekday (but the line started forming shortly after). Take a nice morning stroll to browse the flower market and then fill your stomach here - skip waiting for Tim Ho Wan (which I haven't been to, but friends have denounced it overrated). The shrimp dumplings here are my #1 - and that's saying something since I order those at every dim sum joint. Everything is incredible, honestly you can't go wrong. I usually don't like fried offerings but the skin was SO crisp and flavorful on every dish we had. Service is great as well, do note it is communal seating. Too bad we came on our last day in HK as we surely would've made repeat visits."
One Dim Sum,4,Pretty standard dishes but they were all cooked fresh. I came at 9:45am right before before the rush. Come early or else a huge line starts to form outside. I thought the beef rice noodle rolls were fantastic!
One Dim Sum,5,"I am a big dim sum fan, having grown up eating it. It is still one of my dad's favorite things to eat. There's a lot of hype around this place and I personally think it lived up to it. But I'm not one of those people who is too cool for hype.The wait at noon-ish on a weekday was still quite long, but the place moves super quickly and it didn't feel that long compared to the number of guests being served. There are traditional Cantonese and English menus that are plentiful while waiting. In fact, you place an order while waiting and then the food comes shortly after you sit down. Really good system. We ate the traditional items: shumai, har gow, cheung fun. All really tasty and classic flavors that weren't just doused in salt as may be the case in California. But I must admit some dim sum places in LA and San Jose can hold their own. But the star of the meal was the mango mochi roll. DELICIOUS. If you only come for this, do it!"
One Dim Sum,5,Loved it and would highly recommend.Prices - greatStaff
One Dim Sum,5,"After reading about a little dim sum spot that received a Michelin Star for their food a few years back, we decided we had to check it out. We had a total of 36 hours in Hong Kong and made sure this was one of the 5 meals we has while here. By the end of the night, we declared it the best dim sum we've ever had!The place is in the Prince Edward area of Hong Kong - about 3 blocks from that stop on the red subway line. It's a small shop with seating for roughly 25. They move folks in and out quickly, but never made us feel rushed. We had reservations and that was key as the place was busy the whole time we were around.Three adults, three kids and about 13 dishes made our evening! We put together our order while waiting. They provided a book with pictures of everything for those of us who don't read or speak Chinese. Food pictures truly are a universal language!Everything was incredible! The best of the best however were the Char Siu Bao - hands down the best we've ever experienced! It was like a sweet cloud hugging BBQ Pork as it gracefully danced in my mouth before melting away. It was magical! The sticky rice was also wonderful- not something we're normally super impressed with, but his was perfect. The steamed vermicelli with bbq pork was boss as well!The custard buns were next level and the mango custard rolls were out of this world!The tea came in normal sized mugs which was a nice treat and by the end of the evening, we were stuffed, happy and had experienced the best dim sum we'd ever tasted! The bill for enough to feed 10 people...$50!I can't say enough good about this place! They earned their Michelin Star and continue to perform at a level that few can ever hope to get to. If you're on Hong King, please do yourself a favor and try this place out! You'll be oh so happy you did!"
One Dim Sum,4,"American review on food, less so on traumatic experience of trying to figure this place out. But instructions on what to do: check in at desk, get menu and card to fill out order. Fill out order and return to desk. They will call your number whether or not you have filled out your menu. It's quick and delicious eating. Try: shrimp & veg dumpling, pork dumpling, any of the food is seriously goodAvoid: going for a long sit down meal and conversation- you got to chew & screwGo for: super fast lunch. You'll wait outside for a while."
One Dim Sum,4,"#MemoriesMonday - Remembering Hong Kong... There's Tim Ho Wan and there's also Din Tai Fung.  We've had them elsewhere before and the goal was to find a local place.  We stayed near the Mong Kok District and an all-day dim sum restaurant happened to be walking distance from the Prince Edward Station.  One Dim Sum had a one-Michelin star rating back in the day and it has the 2013 Michelin sticker on its glass wall to prove it.  There was still a wait for a party of four at around 9pm and we had to share a long table with another family when we were seated.  Among those that we tried were:Steamed Sui Mai - Of course, we had to start with these traditional pork and shrimp dumplings.  A bit on the smaller side, but the taste made up for it.  With paper-thin wrapper and the right amount of mushroom, each piece was delicious.  Juicy, too!Steamed Shrimp Dumplings (Har Gow) - Another classic!  The skin was not as translucent as we wanted it to be, but the shrimp was perfectly cooked.  So freshly good!Steamed Vermicelli Roll with Shrimp and Leek Sprouts - One shrimp dish is never enough, so we had to order a family staple.  This is the go-to dim sum of my wife and daughters.  It's not because of the shrimp, but it's due to the sweet sauce that comes with it.  A winner every time!Fried Dumpling with Salted Meat (Ham Sui Kok - Thanks to my Yelp friend Lyla D. from Honolulu, HI for telling me the name) - This is where the sweet meets the savory; the crispy meets the chewy.  The glutinous rice dough perfectly complemented the flavor of the salted pork inside.  A favorite!Steamed Beef Stomach Sheet with Scallions - The owner wanted us to try something outside the norm and we were more than eager to orderbtheir honeycomb tripe.  In general, tripe has a neutral and light taste so, for us, it's the texture that makes it enjoyable.  It had the right amount of chewiness and the touch of ginger and scallion was very fitting.Iced Water - There wasn't!  Unless you're dining in those big, touristic restaurants, expect warm water to be served in small/medium businesses.  This comes with tradition that drinking warm water is better for digestion.Our HK trip was off to a rousing start with a very satisfying dim sum experience at One Dim Sum.  It was the hype of the Michelin star that brought us here, but we were ready to go to another place if it had been packed.  We were fortunate that the stars were aligned that night..."
One Dim Sum,5,"This is seriously the BEST dim sum restaurant I have ever been to. I will put up my dim sum resume with the best of them. Challenge me, I dare you. The wait was not too bad for us, maybe 15 min. The service I found to be decently friendly. But the fooooooood. Oh the food. Cue every song from every Zales commercial. It's magical. My favorite dish was the mango mocha/sticky rice goodness. But honestly every dish here was better than Tim Ho Wan. 100% worth the visit. End of story."
One Dim Sum,5,The best in hongkong!Perfect way to end a tiring day at Disneyland! easy to find - just 2 mins walk from Prince Edward Station (take exit A) Food is superb. Value for money. Staff is friendly.
One Dim Sum,5,"? , ? """", . youtu.be/vkhY23UT0owNow that we got the obligatory head scratching inside joke out of the way, here's the semi-TLDR summary:Delicious dim sum restaurant that seems to cater to both locals and tourists. Pricing is reasonable - especially in high COL Hong Kong - service was speedy and efficient and the vittles were toothsome indeed. Especially delicious were the baked pork buns, har gao (how you like me now?) and the famous mango coconut rice paper thingies. Corazon and I ate to excess with 9 dishes total and with a 10% service charge it only came out to $271 HKD."
One Dim Sum,5,"If you're looking for some authentic dim sum in Hong Kong, this is the place to be. There's always a line out the door, so try to get there early, otherwise they may run out of some of the options. The best one I can recommend is the chicken feet with bean sauce, and also the rice wrapped in lotus leaf."
One Dim Sum,4,"After my long afternoon nap, I was ready to eat dinner at almost 10PM. I came here because of rave reviews from Google, and I thought I would try it. There was a short line when I arrived with stools for the people waiting. They gave me a menu and I told them I couldn't read Chinese so they gave me this photo booklet that had pictures and five different languages to translate for tourists. That was extremely helpful! I ordered the chicken feet, bbq pork rice noodle and shrimp dumplings. I thought the food was good but I like Tim Ho Wan better."
One Dim Sum,3,"I had to try dim sum while in HK and this place was on several foodie lists. Came at 11am and there was already a wait out the door. Luckily they have a bunch of seats outside while you wait for your number to be called. They give you a menu and a tab to pick out your dishes while you're waiting which makes things really quick and efficient once you do get seated. They definitely cater to a more touristy clientele because their menu came in several different languages - English, Korean, German, french to name a few, plus it included pictures which was awesome. It's a small restaurant so any party larger than two would probably have a longer wait unless you came right when it opened. Once we got seated most of our dishes came out right away. We had the siu mai, ha gow, pork spare ribs, Chinese veggies, turnip cakes, baked pork buns and their special dessert mango mochi. The highlight was the mango mochi, I've never had anything like it in the states. The mochi skin was thin and the mango had just the right amount of sweetness. I initially didn't order it but I saw a lot of other tables ordering it so had to get it. It was so good I wanted to order another one but I got denied by the hubs since we already had so much to eat. All in all decent dim sum but wish I had time to try another more local spot to compare since it seemed very touristy."
One Dim Sum,5,"Our family of 4 came here multiple times within our 9 days visits.  We went to Tim Ho Wan and it was a waste of our time, money and effort.  Don't bother going elsewhere but One Dim Sum.  The food was excellent and reasonably priced.  Extra surprise and bonus is the excellent service!  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  I was most impressed by the one guy who was doing the seating.  He went out of his way to help and was so efficient with getting you seated etc.  Even during busy period such as on a Saturday morning, we did not have to wait that long and everything ran smoothly.  You never feel rushed even if it is busy.  Inside was not loud or chaotic like most busy Chinese restaurants.  All the dishes were excellent and consistently good.  Portion was not too small or too big.  Just the right amount.  Our tea was always filled up as needed.  We tried everything.  Pretty sure we looked like piggies but you can always take out your leftovers. ;)Highly recommend One Dim Sum!"
One Dim Sum,5,"Came here on a Sunday late morning, was packed but managed to snag a table for two (seated right next to another party for two at the same table haha...) Great dimsum, great tea, great service, with all the classics and more. Would highly recommend any tourist to try this spot to get their dimsum fix. (I heard from a friend who is a local that One Dim Sum is okay for HK, but there are better spots. Not sure where though...?)"
One Dim Sum,5,Wow. Best restaurant that we went to in Hong Kong!  The Mango rolls are to die for and the bbq pork roll was outstanding!  We ordered 7 dishes( a lot for 2 people) and it was only $210HK. What a bargain!  We only wish we had found this gem earlier in our trip!
One Dim Sum,4,"My daughter was craving dim sum for a few days so we found this restaurant which did not disappoint! There was a queue forming about 10 minutes prior to opening on a Saturday morning which was a good sign! We ordered our favorites - ha gow (shrimp dumplings), shumai (pork and shrimp dumplings) lo bak go (turnip cake), pai gwat (ribs in black bean sauce), hom seiu gok (deep fried dumpling), chive dumpling, shrimp noodle, roast pork noodle and a dessert they are know for - the mango roll. Everything was fresh, hot (except the mango roll) and delicious. The mango roll is a MUST. It is freakin' fantastic! Everything came out promptly and the service was good. Definitely check it out but get there early!"
One Dim Sum,5,"For dim sum in HK, it was pretty darn good.  The mango custard roll was amazing.  It was because the mango was super fresh which made it taste the so good.  The price was good and the inside was clean with good AC.  The service was fast and menu was clearly labeled.  We got everything we wanted.  This place is really good for tourist to try solid dim sum since menus also have English."
One Dim Sum,5,"After our great experience here ton our last HK visit three years ago, the first thing we did after checking into our hotel was to come here for lunch. This popular gem located in an unremarkable neighborhood was  easy to get to from our hotel on Nathan. Short walk from Prince Edward  Metro Station. There was a crowd soon after opening. Our wait was 1/2 hour - put to good use pre-selecting dim sums on the ticket given along with wait number by the gracious host at the door. Menu with pictures available for the uninitiated. Soon we were seated inside the small restaurant with its colorful murals of old Hong Kong street scenes. It's a scene of attentive waitresses hauling a seemingly endless number of bamboo steam baskets to happy anticipating customers at each table. We loved our choices: fresh, sumptuous and delicate. Very satisfying! This place accepts cash only. ATM machines at the metro station."
One Dim Sum,5,"Pro: Down to earth dim sum in HK, cheap price, English menu for those who needs it, late hours.Con: Cash only, possible long line.We came here after getting shoved out by Tim Ho Wan (Olympic) 1 hour before their closing time... Taxi driver mentioned that there could be a long line at 9:30 pm, but our party of 4 got seated pretty quickly. Menu was of the dim sum norm, but much more homey than the mass commercial fame counterpart around town. Highlights were the turnip cake, shui mei, and buns. Place is small, don't bring too much with you. Cash only, be prepared."
One Dim Sum,5,Possibly the best lunch I had on my visit to Hong Kong. This place has one Michelin star and it is obvious why. It doesn't matter how long the line is it is worth the wait. We ordered a ton of food because we wanted to try so many things that looks so incredible. My favorite was the red beat rice cakes... Sorry I can't remember exactly what they were called.
One Dim Sum,5,"A buddy and I were exploring Hong Kong (""It's 'The Kong', man!"" as he would say). I wanted dim sum and he was game for anything. We waited about 30-45 minutes for a table, but we walked out completely stuffed, having eaten some of the most delicious food we could remember, for less than 75HKD (roughly $10USD) each! He and I still talk about that place to this day, and we have been back several times. Every time I come to Hong Kong, I make it a point to take someone there who has never experienced One Dim Sum. I have yet to have one person be less than amazed. The owner even recognized me a couple times and thanked me for bringing in business (not that he needs my help, as his place is always packed, but that sort of gratitude does my heart good).As for dishes, they have everything from the most tame options for the truly reserved Westerner, to the most authentically Chinese bits of deliciousness you could imagine. I'm the adventurous type... the chicken feet were incredible!"
One Dim Sum,5,Delicious and reasonably priced dimsum. All traditional dimsum fares are available. A favorite in the neighborhood! Go early and we didn't have to wait to be seated. Love the murals on the wall too.
One Dim Sum,4,"We had gone to Tim Ho Wan the day before so that probably had ruined our high expectations for One Dim Sum, although they only had the Michelin star for one year and have not gotten it back since.We went during the off hours, around 4PM, so there was no wait. The serving staffs are extremely friendly but the overall food was about on par with average dim sum in the states; hence the extra star for service. We ordered all the main staples: shrimp dumplings (har gao), pork and shrimp dumplings (siu mai), glutinous rice in lotus leaf, shrimp rice rolls, fried beancurd shrimp rolls, and Chinese broccoli. The fillings in the siu mai was a huge let down as it was missing a big chunk of shrimp and was mostly pork and fat. The glutinous rice in lotus leaf was missing some flavors and did not come out piping hot, which affected the taste and texture. The skin of the har gao and the rice rolls was a bit on the softer and mushy side and was no where near as good as Tim Ho Wan. The best part dish we ordered was the deep fried bean curd filled rolls. It was crispy without being overly oily. The servers here are extremely nice and keeps thanking their patrons, which isn't too common for a popular spot in HK."
One Dim Sum,4,Local dim sum place in Kowloon. Tastes standard good / would recommend if you are in the area. A bit crowded / there may be a line but that's part of the local experience.
One Dim Sum,5,"I was extremely excited to try dim sum for the first time. I am lucky enough to have had that experience in Hong Kong at One Dim Sum. Echoing the sentiments of other Yelp reviewers, this place is authentic and affordable, despite us ordering more than the average person. Especially notable dishes were the veggie dumplings and sponge cake. Service was efficient and prompt, despite our large order and many parties being served inside the small restaurant or waiting outside."
One Dim Sum,3,"Long wait (go check out the flower and bird market nearby)Cash onlyPhoto menu (easy to point and order)No bathroom immediately available insideFriendly service Tourist friendly~~~Order:Deep fried Salty DumplingsBaked Char siu bunCoconut Mango Dessert (AMAZING)Shrimp rice rolls (any of the rolls would be good, but that's what I ordered)Skip:Small pork ribs with black bean sauceChicken feet*these are my favorite dim sum plates, but they were a bit oily fattyOverall, this place is a simple dim sum place that's definitely over-hyped. I would say skip this place if you're in a group and just order to-go. If you're flying solo, I would say go for it. I would only return for those delicious coconut mango treats, sooo good! Happy Dim-sum everyone!"
One Dim Sum,5,Really good dim sum at very reasonable prices. Expect to queue and wait plus share in tiny spaces. All the food we tried were spot on. Except the lava custard Buns which weren't as flow-y as we like. Pro tip: there's a English menu with pictures if so required.
One Dim Sum,3,"Ever have that moment where everyone likes a certain movie, but you're the only that didn't like (or even borderline hated) it? That's essentially the story of One Dim Sum (一點心) and I. I've given them numerous chances to win my Dim Sum loving heart over, but alas, I've come away unimpressed almost every time.I keep asking myself: -- Is it the wait? There are people lined up to the teeth here almost every day, any hour of the day. They even have a dozen chairs outside, more than I've seen for any establishment. Waiting is never an issue for me for any food worthy of hype. But at least ... there are chairs.-- Is it the fact it's notorious touristy? I've yet to see a non-Chinese picture menu with as many languages as they have it in. There is Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Thai. No love for the Spanish, but that language might as well not exist in this part of the world.-- Is it the service? The fact they push people to order even before they sit or how they rush certain patrons because the interior is tiny? Not ever a problem in my book. Inconvenient yes, but certainly not a deal breaker, especially for Chinese cuisine.It's the Dim Sum. I don't want to say I take my Dim Sum seriously but if there is one thing I can't do is subpar versions of it. I was okay with the Siu Mai (燒賣), Shrimp Dumplings (蝦餃), Egg Crisps (蛋散) and Lo Mai Gai (糯米雞) but the rest were a bit lackluster despite having them multiple times. They include the BBQ Pork Buns (叉燒包), Spare Ribs (排骨), Pork Puff Pastry (鹹水角), and Rice Noodles (腸粉). There are a few one and done (i.e. so bad I didn't want to try another) dishes, which were the most expensive ones like the Black Pepper Veal Chop (黑椒牛仔骨), Ginger Scallion Tripe (薑蔥牛栢業), and Chicken w/Mushroom + Fish Maw (匕菇棉花雞). Strangely enough, I'd still tell people to come here even if I didn't enjoy it as much. I'm probably (certainly) missing something, but I'm also not in a hurry to find out."
One Dim Sum,5,"If you want to know what the difference between dim sum in the states versus dim sum in Hong Kong then you must come here and try it out yourself. The options are similar but seriously, the main difference is the quality and taste. It must be something in the water because it was so good here! Dim sum in the states will never taste the same again. This place set the bar too high.My friends and I went to two different dim sum places in Hong Kong, and this place stole our hearts. The flavor of the dim sum, freshness, and the sauces were the main factors. The customer service here (like everywhere else in Hong Kong) wasn't superb, but it wasn't horrible like other places either. There's a menu with pictures and numbers and you would just check what number you want on the slip at your table. Just a warning though: Make sure you remember what you ordered because we didn't receive some items we checked. The line gets pretty long. We arrived half an hour before they opened and there wasn't a long line, but when we left, the line was ridiculous. So plan accordingly and enjoy!"
One Dim Sum,4,"Har Gow and Siu Mai was on smaller side. The Char Siu Cheung Fen was very delicious and had a large amount of meat in it. Price was a little expensive, but I guess since it has a Michelin Star, you are paying more for the quality than the quantity here. Definitely not a hole in the wall anymore as 75% of the people visiting were tourists. I waited about 20-25 minutes to get a seat as a solo diner. During that time I got list and checked the items I wanted to order. While I didn't ask for tea, they basically poured the tea for me and charged me. From the time I was seated to me receiving all the orders I had ordered was about 10 minutes."
One Dim Sum,3,Don't waste your HK experience at this dim sum place!! I'd walk a few blocks to Tim Ho Wan!! Price is comparable but the dim sum is much better at Tim Ho Wan!
One Dim Sum,3,"I probably spoiled myself too much with dim sun before going to this place. Besides the custard bun, I found the other dishes pretty tasteless."
One Dim Sum,4,Decent quality Dim Sum. Not sure what the Michelin Star deal is but they had the signs up in their windows. Have yet to do my research on them regarding it. Quite cheap prices. Ordered four items for only $77 HKD! That's less than $10USD! The fried shrimp roll in some sort of tofu skin deal was absolutely delicious and highly recommend getting it! Only disappointment was their terribly bland tea that tasted of hot water. Even the dirt cheap Hot Food Courts have better tea than this Michelin starred joint! Super busy yet grabbed a seat immediately as I decided to eat alone and lucked out not having to wait. Yay!
One Dim Sum,5,"I LOVE this place. Lines do get long (I waited for 45 min on a Friday night), but you can view the menu and put in your order before you sit down. Make sure to get a number when you arrive for your spot. Everything is phenomenal & cheap, and the staff is so nice! Some stuff do run out as the day progresses. Most everything is delicious - beef wrapped noodles, char siu bao (pork buns), shrimp har gao (dumplings), glutenous rice (sticky rice in banana leaf). The sesame balls with black sesame paste inside is life changing. Slightly sweet and so much texture! What a great experience. Cash only. If lines are too long, you can also order takeout."
One Dim Sum,3,Ordered a bunch of dishes to try and everything was good but nothing outstanding. When you are in line the waitress will provide an order sheet for you to make your selection which speeds up the process
One Dim Sum,3,"Not sure why this is rated so highly. It was average dim sum not as good as some others in Hong Kong and definitely not worth a trip if you aren't already in the neighborhood. One of our favorites is rice noodle roll. We ordered both the shrimp and bbq pork. The shrimp roll was bland and the texture of the rice noodle on both of them was not as fine and velvety as they should be. The sauce was also bland. We also ordered har gow, bbq pork buns, shu mei, shrimp and vegetable dumpling with peanuts and a fried shrimp wonton. Nothing extraordinary and was not worth the 30 minute wait. If you're looking for cheap dim sum on the Kowloon side this is an option as our entire bill was only $12 US but I'd rather pay a bit more for a tastier experience."
One Dim Sum,5,"I've always enjoyed dim sum quite a bit, but more recently I have found myself really sealing it out. I've tried it in several different countries and I feel like I am really getting the hang of it. After getting lost a few times on foot trying to reach One Dim sum, I was more than relieved once I sat down to grab a few tasty treats. This place was all time! The dough and vermicelli was perfectly cooked and the meats inside each piece that I ordered were delicious! I didn't have any gristly pieces of fat which is a big turn off of mine.I have eaten at tim ho wan and I actually find this place a little better. The steamed pork bun was so fluffy and perfectly sweet! The walk was well worth it. I was able to sit down without an issue at around 2pm. I was by myself however, but I did notice that people were moving fairly quickly there so it wasn't too bad if you came during a peak hour.Enjoy!"
One Dim Sum,5,"In my opinion, One Dim Sum is probably the BEST Dim Sum place in all of Hong Kong! Even better than its Michelin starred rival, Tim Ho Wan because of its consistent quality throughout its menu. Pros: -Authentic, great flavors-Traveler-friendly (the menu comes in different languages) -A good value for the quality you receive-A-la carte (like all Dim Sum restaurants), so you can try a lot of different dishes Cons: -Long waits"
One Dim Sum,5,"Michelin star! My dim sum journey continued into this place.  Got there even before it opened and already a line.  Service was excellent and so was the food.  Food tasted authentic and affordable.  Quick and easy, order eat and leave!  Definitely in the ball park as Tim Ho Wan!"
One Dim Sum,5,"The Michelin star doesn't lie! One Dim Sum is a truly delightful dim sum experience, and cannot be missed when in Hong Kong. The restaurant is just a block away from the Prince Edward MTR station, so getting here is pretty easy. Try to get here within 5-10 minutes of opening (or ideally, a few minutes before they open). We did this as a party of two, and only had to wait 10 minutes. However, when we were seated (about 15 minutes after opening), the wait had already grown to 10+ groups. Definitely try to arrive early to minimize your wait.There is a multilingual menu that you can peruse while you wait, which is convenient. It even includes pictures of every dish, so dim sum newbies needn't worry. You can mark your order sheet ahead of time and hand it over to them when they call your number--this ensures that your food will arrive at your table ASAP.Some highlights of our meal were the fried dumplings with salted meat (harm shui kok), steamed vermicelli rolls with BBQ pork (chong fun), steamed shrimp dumplings (har gao), baked char siu pork buns, and the mango custard rolls. Everything was the best rendition of that item I've ever had, except for the baked char siu pork buns--Tim Ho Wan steals the show for those, but One Dim Sum's version is definitely in second place.Service is actually friendly and not rude at all, which is always a pleasant surprise when in Hong Kong. Be prepared to share a table, since that's also common in Hong Kong during peak times. Overall, this is a meal that I certainly don't recommend skipping."
One Dim Sum,4,"Small place that serves up a variety of dim sum.  They have a picture book for people who can't read Chinese.  Got lo may gay (Sticky rice), shrimp spinach dumpling, and shrimp rice roll.The lotus wrapped sticky rice was huge, taking up the entire bamboo steamer.  Rice was good perfectly with great texture, not mushy at all!  It was filled with meat which was yummy! Shrimp spinach dumpling was decent.  Filling was packed in and skin was pretty good.I wasn't a fan of the shrimp rice roll.  The texture of the rice roll was too mushy.I went when it was too busy and there was no line.  Service was actually really attentive and the lady must've been bored cause she kept talking to me.Anyways, a decent option for quick and simple dim sum."
One Dim Sum,5,A small hole in the wall place that's very popular with local and tourist alike. Personally i like this place better than the popular Tim ho wan but this place is a lot smaller so the wait time is longer.  good chicken feet and sui mai.
One Dim Sum,5,"This is my favorite dim sum restaurant in the world....The restaurant is small with about 30 seats in a modern décor.  It was very comfortable as opposed to the madness found in larger places. The lighting was excellent and I hope you enjoy my photos...Although their dim sum selection is smaller than other restaurants, everything is at a higher level. Nothing is in-your-face ""amazing"" like an overrated Tim Ho Wan roast pork bun, but the basics of dim sum are totally mastered here...from the tightly wrapped dumplings to the light curry flavored sauce which allows the squid to shine...The managers and waitresses are great as well. They're friendly and speak to you in a non-rushed manner. They create a relaxed environment for you to enjoy your dim sum...It was awarded a Michelin star in 2012, but unfortunately did not retain it. This is not an entirely bad thing though as sometimes Michelin stars bring too much chaos to an establishment such as the environment at Tim Ho Wan in SSP. The overall experience of dining at One Dim Sum is superior in my book despite not currently having the star. After all, it's about how you personally enjoy dim sum as opposed to letting the Michelin Guide decide for you..."
One Dim Sum,3,"If you have patience and have a great love for dim sum, perhaps the one hour plus wait at this place will be worth your time. This small little restaurant gets crazy packed and if you go near lunch time, expect the wait to be at least 1 hour or more long. Based on reviews and personal recommendations, my friends and I came here for dim sum. Once you arrive, make sure you check in with the host/hostess, get a number, grab a menu, and proceed to wait till your number is called. While waiting, make sure to look through the menu (English is included) and make your order selections off the ordering slip. When it's closer to when you'll get seated, the hostess will collect your ordering slip to help expedite the process on getting your food ready and such when you're in the restaurant. Be aware of the number calling! Many people will try to cut through and ask for number status, so don't get lost in the crowd.Man.....once all of us got a seat, it was feastin' time. Most of the dim sum dishes tasted delicious and fresh. Portions were moderate and if you're in a group of 3, it's a perfect number since a lot of items came in that amount. My most favorite are the rice rolls stuffed with something in it. Tried all the different options and each was solidly awesome. If you're adventurous, I would recommend the chicken feet! It's quite flavorful and juicy, and the abundance of skin on the feet makes it feel meatier than the average chicken feet feel. For dessert or something refreshing, I highly recommend the mango dessert. It's sweet and refreshing with the yummy real mango piece inside of it. Overall, the food was great and decently priced however, the service was a bit lacking. Right before my friends and I could finish our final bites and to figure out the bill, we were already ushered out by the staff to get up and get going. We would have been fine getting up while eating since there is a huge crowd outside, but when 2-3 people start scolding/hissing at us in Cantonese (which 2 of us don't understand at all) to leave, it's quite a turn off.  Despite the great food, I didn't enjoy my experience too much with the long wait and rude staff service."
One Dim Sum,5,"If you find yourself in Hong Kong, and you only have time to go to one dim sum restaurant, let this be the one!While visiting Hong Kong, I was able to check out several dim sum establishments (including Tim Ho Wan) but One Dim Sum easily out-shined them all. This one Michelin star rated restaurant provides extremely high quality dim sum in a no frills, small, but comfortable setting. Service was nothing to write home about however very attentive. The dishes I was able to try was the shui mai, spare ribs, shrimp dumplings (har gow), beef balls, water chestnut cake, and fried dumplings. Everything was amazing and easily the best I've ever had.The only negative I found is that there is always a wait and since there are only a few tables, they will rush you out if you finished your meal and don't order more food.  Protip for visitors & tourists: Make sure to write your name down on the list and ask for a time estimate. Then while waiting check out the bird market a few blocks away."
One Dim Sum,3,"After trying Tim Ho Wan yesterday, I was excited to try One Dim Sum today. They had an English menu which was helpful but I was unimpressed with this place.First off, they were out of the one thing I came here for - the baked bbq buns. They neglected to tell us this so we ended up staring at the wait staff for 10 minutes. Then they told us they're out of spring rolls but they had just put down 2 orders on the table of 5 Chinese women next to us. We had even ordered first. They eventually gave us an order, and mistakenly didn't charge us for them.Even with all of this, if the food had been amazing, I would have been happy.... but it wasn't, so.... yeah.Tim Ho Wan is a much better choice in my opinion. Not sure how this place got a Michelin star to be honest."
One Dim Sum,5,"To those who haven't been in Hong Kong for that long, One Dim Sum is a secret dimsum gem tucked away in the bumbling corners of Prince Edward. One of the best giveaways of its location would be the line that forms outside on weekend mornings.One Dim Sum has fantastic dishes across every spectrum: carbs, meats, and veggies. My friend and I ordered ten things off the menu because we were so excited about the food! Needless to say, they were more than delicious. My favorite two dishes from One Dim Sum would have to be the ham shui kok (fried dumplings) and the congee. Their flavors were quite on point and each bite made me want to eat more. If you're reading this review at One Dim Sum, be excited!! There's so much goodness waiting to be eaten."
One Dim Sum,5,"This place was really good. I want to go again! Standouts for me include the bbq pork rice roll, mango roll dessert, baked bbq buns, & har gao. I want to try more dishes here!"
One Dim Sum,5,"It's a small, cramped spot, much like most restaurants in Hong Kong, and there's always a line. Luckily, as a single diner, you can sometimes find a random extra seat at a table of three, for instance. And I did. In fact, this happened to me last year as well. My neighbors were very nice, and I could get their advice on ordering. They do have an English language menu, so no worries if you don't speak Chinese. Frankly, everything has a picture next to it anyway. I had prawn dumplings, pork shumai, bbq pork buns and veal with black pepper. All were delicious, though the veal, the one non-dim sum item, comes on the bone much like Korean style short ribs, only a bit fattier/chewier. Still the flavor was there, and the flavor on the dim sum items was superb. There's a reason for the line, of course.The servers are very nice, and while not all of them speak much English, we made it work. Just like in Japan, pointing usually works, and my neighbors pitched in to make sure I was taken care of. I'm sure on my next trip to Hong Kong, I'll be back!"
One Dim Sum,3,"Mediocre at best. Not sure what the hype is about.  I've had better in NYC and SF.  I'd go if it's the closest thing, open and could not wait to eat. Happy eating!"
One Dim Sum,3,"The best aspect of One Dim Sum is its ingredients were extremely fresh. However if you ever had good Dim Sum from some of the best places in the United States, it's really just 10-15% better. My reference point is in the metro DC area (including Maryland and Northern Virginia) - so in that sense, I found One Dim Sum to be just okay.We tried a a bunch of dishes that vary from shumai to beef intestines. We also had radish cake and meat balls. Again they're better than the dim sum we can get back at the States, but just marginal. Service was okay, though they forgot one of our dishes even after I had asked about it - no worries as that can happen when things are busy.It's a safe B- choice if you decide not to try out a dim sum place without Yelp reviews."
One Dim Sum,4,"One of the world's cheapest (and quickest service, and most delicious) Michelin star restaurants in the world! Coming from the Washington D.C./Northern Virginia area, where some of the 'best' east coast dim sum spots can be found, I can safely say One Dim Sum easily stood out. Between 2 people, we ordered the you tiao, 2 bowls of congee, pork buns, pork ribs and chicken feet; and we left stuffed. Normally, there would have been leftovers but the dim sum was simply too good to leave behind uneaten! The crunchy you tiao was a pleasant change from the usually 'soggy' ones you find in the US.For those complaining about the wait time - the solution is easy: simply come before the lunch rush! We arrived around 11 am and did not have to wait. By 11:15am, the line was out the door."

One Dim Sum,3,I was not at all impressed with the food at One Dimsum especially considering this place has a significant amount of yelp reviews in comparison with many other local restaurants in the area. I've lived in brooklyn for most of my life and I'm sad to say that there are dimsum places in brooklyn that served tastier dimsum than this one in Hong Kong. I went late (10pm) and the restaurant was still packed. A good portion of the items on the menu were sold out so we didn't get to try everything we wanted to.
One Dim Sum,4,"Dim Sum in Hong Kong is a can't miss! Almost have to eat dim sum every day cause they are priced good and taste food as well. When I visited Hong Kong, I wanted to try as many dim sum places as possible so gave One Dim Sum a try because of the good reviews as well as Michelin Star Rated. It is located only a few walk away after exiting Prince Edward Station. So not a difficult place to find and is only a few minute walk from the MTR. The moment I found it and walked right up to the store, there was already a long line and it was around 10 a.m and I had to wait about 45 minutes and there a few seats outside for you to sit at and wait. Make sure you get number as well as an order menu. Even though I speak and understand Cantonese, I do not know how to read Chinese, so an English Menu was really helpful. So make sure you get a number, grab a menu to look at pictures of the food they offer as well as the order menu, so you can have your food choices made up beforehand and have them fulfill your order quickly once you are seated inside. Now to the foods. I ordered Shiu Mai, Preserved Egg Congee, Custard Bun, Har Gow, Steamed Shrimp Rice Noodles, and BBQ Pork Steamed Bun. May I say everything was great, not too oily, warm and the congee was just the right amount for two people. Definitely fresh dim sum and hot. The orders came out pretty fast, and I finished them like a hungry foodie. There was no tea pot so you would have to call for refill. Custard Bun and BBQ Pork Steamed Bun came in two and was big with melting custard and good pork that were both delicious. Shiu Mai and Har Gow was great as well. Rice Noodles was great as well. Overall, the food was great, and priced was definitely alright as well.Overall, the foods are great and I cannot get over the taste of dim sum in Hong Kong compared to the ones in L.A. There may not be a big difference, but after you have tried many from Hong Kong and tried the ones here there is a bit of a difference in taste be it freshness or taste. The only negative would be the wait as well as the seating where it may be a bit small and compacted. Service was just ok, price is great. One Dim Sum is one dim sum restaurant I would not miss out the next time I am in Hong Kong!"
One Dim Sum,5,"The reviews on Yelp isn't too hot for this place, but it is like 4.5 stars on OpenRice. I love One Dim Sum. This was by far one of the best dim sum experiences that I have ever been a part of. The food was so fresh and hot. I enjoyed the lists of options, as compared to Tim Ho Wan in Sham Shui Po. The 35+ minute wait was well worth it for authentic dishes such as chicken feet and cheung fan. It is also a good place to practice your Cantonese. It is best to go with a party of 4 and simply order the entire menu. It came out to be roughly $12 USD per person for about 12 dishes."
One Dim Sum,4,"This is the cheapest Michelin star place I've ever eaten at. It's a small, homey restaurant that's open late and in the middle of a street with tons of bars. I was expecting some amazing dim sum, but all I got was good dim sum. It was very good dim sum, but not the greatest and didn't really live up to the hype for me. The service was good and they made sure we were taken care of. It's definitely worth going to, but if you've had good dim sum, it's really hard to make it excellent."
One Dim Sum,5,"Great dim sum at reasonable prices. This place was recommended to us by a friend and we were not let down! Happened to be in the neighborhood early and ended up snatching a table before the queue built up outside. Food came fast and was very delicious!We had steamed dumplings and veal, which came with complimentary tea that was refilled continuously without us having to ask. Our favorite was by far the dessert, which was mango custard rolls. They were so yummmmmmmmyyyy! Could've gone for seconds but was too stuffed.6 dishes ran us just under 150 :-)"
One Dim Sum,3,"I had high expectations for this spot after seeing all the great reviews on Yelp. However, the food was disappointing. It was alright, but not worth it making a special trip here. There are few seats here, as it's a small restaurant, so the customers are squeezed tight together. The two of us were seated at a booth, but told to sit next to each other, so they could seat 2 strangers across from us. Since there was no room for our bags, it was brought behind the cash register and kept there during our meal. It was rather awkward, as the little girl in front of me started to draw on the wall with her pencil and was constantly swinging her legs. Overall, the food was okay. The only dish I would definitely recommend is the Steamed cake Malay style. Ultimately, I feel that the dining experience here was mediocre and rushed so that they could clear the table ASAP and seat the next customers."
One Dim Sum,3,Based on two recent visits.  High percentage of patrons are english-speaking tourists.  Anything on the menu using roast pork is to be avoided - very low quality.  Ordinary food in an ordinary environment.  Meh.
One Dim Sum,4,"Good dimsum, but not so amazing I'll dream about this for years to come. Still, way better than the states (at least near me). I was just disappointed after having dimsum earlier in the week that just blew my socks off. The dimsum here is priced really well. I thought the shumai was great, and I don't even like shumai. I also liked the shrimp wrapped noodles :). Not much more I can say. 4 people at to their hearts content for around $32USD."
One Dim Sum,5,"Love that they offer picture menu of their dim sum with 8 or 9 different languages...definitely tourist friendly. My group came here after trying Tim Ho Wan the other day so our expectations were pretty up there. Although we ended up comparing each dish to THW, this place did not disappoint. Their pork shumai was definitely the highlight. Wish I could have some RN :("
One Dim Sum,5,"First, there a pictures and numbers menu, in English. So very helpful.Prepare to wait. It's a popular spot and space is limited, so you'll probably won't be seated right away."
One Dim Sum,4,"We really enjoyed the dim sum. The wait was pretty serious, but very well organized. It pays to check on the pronunciation of your ticket number in Cantonese they call those numbers for the tables and only call out in Cantonese. I think it is worth the visit if you are an enthusiast. That said, my wife and I are pretty serious about Dim Sum, and found the fare here to be at the same level as Koi Palace in Daly City, CA. So, if you are used to that level, don't be disappointed that it isn't better, but equal. Definatly a great price to food ratio."
One Dim Sum,3,"I tried this place as my first dim sum experience at HK. The place is packed with people and there was a huge line up when i arrived, at about 3 pm. I had nothing in the morning and I was starving. I was going to leave when I saw the line but decided to ask first about the waiting time. Luckily, I was seated immediately as they happen to have a table for 1, so I was pretty happy about that. I ordered 5 different things in total, the shrimp dumplings (4, flavour is actually decent with some vinegar, otherwise a mediocre 3.5), boiled Chinese vegetables with soy sauce (3, decent portion, undercooked stems and the vegetable itself is old), steamed beef stomach sheets with scallion (4, not usually a fan for spicy food, but a tiny bit of spiciness helped in this case, also recommend to dip in vinegar to add some flavour) , pork and one thousand year old egg congee (3 initially as the meat was a bit old, after taste boosted it to a 3.5, decent portion), and lastly for dessert, BBQ pork stuffed in the bun (cannot remember the name, but it's not the BBQ pork bun, the bun is soft for this one, 4). This place is overall a 3.5 for me. They have a mandatory HK5 dollar tea fee, common in dim sum place though. Price is overall okay, I think I spend a bit over 100 and left pretty full. I might come again, but would like to try other places first to establish a better reference point, right now I am cross referencing to the ones I had in Canada."
One Dim Sum,1,"I can't believe this is a one star Michelin rated restaurant. SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Probably rated by tourists who haven't eaten authentic dim sum. I would say the name says it all: one-[time visit] dim sum. Plenty of other places that serve tasty dim sum. This place served over-cooked, tasteless, and HUGE portions that defeit the purpose of dim sum. Go elsewhere! Recommendation: Very Good Seafood Restaurant on Nathan Road. I usually don't like restaurants named with adjectives as an attempt to sell themselves but this restaurant was recommended by locals and it really is VERY GOOD."
One Dim Sum,5,"They are excellent doing what they have to do. You have to queue to get in,You can visit the flower market Near by and get ready to taste delicious local dishes.Everything we had was really good, do not get there to late in case they run out of their best seller..Victim of his own success"
One Dim Sum,5,"This place has the best dim sum in Hong Kong for the best prices. Spent two weeks trying out many different restaurants, and this came out at the top of my list. Food is very reasonably priced and quality is beyond most dim sum restaurants you'll find in Hong Kong. The staff were very kind and accommodating, even when we came in minutes before their closing time. And To top it off, it's super close to the Prince Edward station. If your ever in Hong Kong, I highly recommend visiting this place for some absolutely amazing dim sum."
One Dim Sum,5,"I came here after browsing the markets of Mong Kok on my last day in Hong Kong on a Monday afternoon. I was traveling solo but already sensing preemptive dim sum withdrawals (my return flight was the next morning). Yeah, I know, dim sum is usually a social activity but you know what, no one ever said doing it solo was a crime.Well, it worked out in my favor. Everyone else had to wait almost 45 minutes but I only had to wait ten! I guess they have a single tiny table for solo parties like myself. I only got to try four different dishes (which was already a food coma waiting to happen) but each of them was delicious and better than any spot I had ever been to in HK or America. My favorite was the coconut mango dessert. Damn - one of the best things I had in HK. Awesome service, amazing, affordable food, waitstaff was kind and seemed to get a kick out of the fact that I was a young American girl on an unstoppable food mission. And, what the heck, now you can say you've been to a Michelin star restaurant for less than $20. It's worth the trip, for the bragging rights AND the delicious food!"
One Dim Sum,3,"This place evidently is Zagat rated. Actually I found nothing really special about it. You can get dim sum just as good or better in Chicago Chinatown. Didn't regret calling, but I would not go out of my way to find it"
One Dim Sum,5,this little place serves very fine food !I  basically ordered way too much and didn't think I could finish but it was all so tasty that I managed   ( hurray !.. I'm a fat bastard !! ;-)   I think there are less choices here than other larger dim sum places which to me means they can really focus on making their dishes perfect ... I will go back again for sure !!  The staff is also very nice
One Dim Sum,4,"Maybe it's because of its star ratings so I expected much more. The char siew bun and bao were very good. As was the siew mai, lo mai Kai and rice rolls. Har kow was only normal. Carrot cake was good so I bought a box to bring home!"
One Dim Sum,5,"OH MY DELICIOUS. One Dim Sum is a cozy, little restaurant. We arrived at around 2pm on a Friday and thankfully beat the lunch rush. The wait time was 10-15 minutes. Once we sat down and ordered, the food came pretty quickly.The service was great, and of the popular dim sum places we've tried (ex: Tim Ho Wan), we definitely liked One Dim Sum the best! The menu was limited, but just enough. My favorites: steamed pork buns, baked BBQ pork buns, egg custard buns, vermicelli with beef, Siu Mai. I always ordered steamed shrimp dumplings (xiao jiao), but the one here tasted off, which was one downside of this place. They also served a mango custard dessert with coconut shavings. The mango was very fresh! It was really good, but by the end of the meal, we could not consume another bite (so.much.food.). For 8 dishes, our total came out to 162HKD for 3 people, which is such a steal for such a scrumptious meal!"
One Dim Sum,3,"Really wanted to try this place after almost all websites that I went to trying to find the best dim sum advised one dim sum! The prices are relatively good & the dim sum is amazing! Only food I was eh about was steamed rice rolls because ive had better but they're not bad. When I arrived there was a long line outside waiting (I went on a Sunday). They really worked this place up to have the seats filled up fast so the wait time is less. However, I would have rather waited longer and I'll tell you why. Our table was small & looks like it's for 2 people. But they put 4 chairs there, so when we were seated (party of 3), another person came to share the table with us. I know it is common practice in HK to share tables with strangers while eating but this was too much. Everyone knows while eating dimsum you'll have many plates... which this table & trying fit everything while still having even a slightest personal space was impossible. As a result of many different plates + small table + sharing with someone else, we had to stack the dimsum. Which meant we had to finish one to get to the next dimsum. Overall, the food is amazing but the reason why I gave them 3 stars is that my experience here felt uncomfortable & rushed (reason why I forgot to take pics of most of my dimsum). Ps: yes I have shared tables before but it was fine because tables are usually big and you get your own personal space. You didn't feel like if you talked your spit would get into strangers food."
One Dim Sum,4,Good and consistent with 2 flaws this time.  Sui Mai was too small. Char Sat buns was all fat. Rest was good as always
One Dim Sum,5,"First meal and stop in HK (after the hotel). Small, packed, and a queue to get in.I ordered the shu mai and har gow. Piping hot and tasty and juicy and medium sized. Tasty. Good for a quick bite to eat before wandering the goldfish market nearby"
One Dim Sum,4,"This place was recommended by an instagram friend and I'm very glad we tried it. We arrived around 7PM and there was already a line. Luckily for us we didn't have to wait long as we were only two. It's a typical chinese restaurant. The place is small and there's not much room between each table so you won't be able to avoid your neighbors conversation and they will hear yours. But you're coming here for dim sum and that's all matters. We ordered 6 steamed dishes, 1 plate of chinese broccoli and for dessert, some egg custard buns. All came with complimentary tea that was constantly refilled.The food came out pretty fast and was very fresh. Everything was delicious and the portions were quite big. I guess we ordered a little bit too much for two people but we end up eating all of it still because it was too good to waste!For 8 dishes we paid 140$HK which is very cheap compared to the other dim sum places we went and none were as good as this one. As we paid, the person I think was the owner, asked us if everything was to our taste and if we enjoyed the food. He was sincerely interested to know where we were from and if it was our first time at the restaurant. I really appreciated his concern to know if his customers loved the food. No wonder it was packed, and not only by expats but by locals as well. I will definitely keep this one on my list and come back a few times on our next trip here."
One Dim Sum,5,Very nice Dim Sum place in the neighborhood.  You will taste  the authentic Hong Kong Snacks here with very affordable price. I recommend this place if you don't mind to wait in line.
One Dim Sum,4,"After some research online I went to One Dim Sum. I sat relatively quickly since I was solo. I ordered the minced meat ball, which was good but the sweet vinegar made it even better. Then my favorite, the shrimp rice roll. The sticky rice was nice as well. The curry squid had an amazing sauce but I found the squid too chewy and could have used some more slicing."
One Dim Sum,4,"Shu mai, turnip cake, short ribs, shrimp dumplings with chives, steamed vermicelli roll with beef, steamed vermicelli roll with shrimp and leeks. Everything was very tasty. I usually need chili or mustard sauce, but this place didn't need them! I'm not a particular fan of shu mai but theirs were tender, juicy, and flavorable. We waited 30 minutes in line around 8pm so I recommend coming here during off-peak hours. Cash only and with a Michelin star."
One Dim Sum,5,Best dim sum so far in homgkong. Small but authentic food. Fair price and tasty food. Definitely check it out!
One Dim Sum,5,"This is a nice little spot in Prince Edward. This is a dim sum spot where you mark your order on a sheet of paper as opposed to having dim sum ladies coming around with carts. The dim sum comes out pretty fast once you have chosen what you want and get seated. Everything was absolutely delicious. I have only had dim sum back in LA, SF, and NY, this absolutely blows them away. Everything is worth getting, but I think the particular highlights are the chicken feet and the fish maw. This is simply dim sum done right."
One Dim Sum,5,"One Dim Sum is amazing, and I am never going to Tim Ho Wan again.Sure, my boyfriend and I had to wait for about 45 minutes at this small restaurant on a weekday for lunch, and my stomach was grumbling for a long time, but the dishes were incredibly delicious. Only one type of tea is served. Menus are available in English (with pictures!), which is so helpful for us ABCs who can't read Chinese! We ordered the standard fare of shu mai, char siu bao, ham shui kok, shrimp rice roll, and sesame balls.  Ham shui kok is definitely one of their best, with a perfectly crispy exterior but soft and tasty interior. We noticed that a lot of the other patrons ordered the mango coconut dessert as well, but by then, we were stuffed.What makes the dim sum so good? For one, each dish comes out piping hot from the kitchen, instead of sitting in a cart or who knows where all day. Sadly, my memory escapes me as to the exact differences of each dish, but my overall impression was that this place offered the best dim sum I have had so far."
One Dim Sum,4,We arrived around lunch time so we weren't surprised about the wait (approx 30 minutes or so$. Their menu is in English with pictures and what's nice is that you can order while waiting to expedite the process. The staff was very nice and accommodating plus the food was amazing! Definitely a must while visiting HK!
One Dim Sum,5,"Best dim sum in Hong Kong! Previously awarded a Michelin star, once you eat here you'll know why. Their meatballs are a must try, no doubt my all time favourite. The mango dessert is also unlike any other! Menu with photos and English makes it easy for those who need it. Efficient service is a bonus. So stoked to have eaten here!"
One Dim Sum,4,"Great dim sum but the wait in the heat and humidity is just brutal! Hey, take it as free sauna! Still, it is worth the wait! We went there three times during our three week visit to HK so far. Wish they have a larger restaurant to accommodate all the patrons!  One of the waitress was quite unfriendly --- maybe due to working so hard in such a busy and tight space! Can't wait to go again tomorrow."
One Dim Sum,5,"Very small, cozy, crowded seating, busy and fast paced. There's always a huge line out the door, I think mainly because they can only seat so few people inside. The decor is clean and new looking. I didn't have very high expectations for this small dim sum place, but after ordering a few things, they really impressed me with their dim sum dishes. The highlights were the rice rolls, the shrimp dumpling and their DELICIOUS HAM SUI KOK. I don't even liked fried things and I LOVED their ham sui kok. They totally nailed it!! I wish I had time to come here again for their dim sum, but there was just too little time and too many other restaurants to try in Hong Kong. Oh well, hopefully I'll come visit again and this place will still be here the next time I visit!"
One Dim Sum,5,"Stellar dim sum here. My husband and I stopped by after a trip to the flower and bird markets nearby, and the wait was about 40 minutes--worth every second of waiting, by the way. The process for getting a table is this: check-in at the front desk, and the attendant will give you a menu, an order form, and a pencil; mark what you want; hand it all back into the attendant, who will give you a slip of paper with a number; and then wait until the attendant ushers you into the restaurant. There are maybe a dozen or so tables inside, tops, so your wait will depend on the number of people ahead of you. Once inside, the food arrives very quickly."
One Dim Sum,5,I love the food at One Dim Sum! The restaurant does not have all the dishes as a normal dim sum restaurant has and the place is not too big and the tables are cramped together - but that's the charm. Since I knew it was quite a popular restaurant we went there early and I hear locals being baffled that so many foreigners have started finding their little hidden gems. The food was spectacular and my company and I really enjoyed every single dish that was served. My favourite was the bbq pork pineapple bun (叉燒菠蘿包) which was the best one I have ever had. One Dim Sum is a must go to place!
One Dim Sum,3,"Not bad, overrated because of their Michelin Stars. Always filled with tourists big line 24/7. I mean you can way better yum cha at other places around MK . But this has an authentic taste"
One Dim Sum,4,This is really good dim sum.  You can tell a lot of care goes into the preparation.  The Ma Lay (a kind of steamed cake) is extraordinarily tender.  The veggie dumplings are flavourful and a welcome change from Hong Kong's meats and sweets.  Can be lined up but it is very much worth both the trip and the wait.
One Dim Sum,5,"As I stated in my check-in...the dim sum here is quite yummy.  So many flavors to experience and did not disappoint.  If your to visit Hong Kong, make sure you make this a starting place. The dumplings and steamed buns are fantastic, the mango custard roll is perfect.  The staff is friendly even with a language barrier.  The place is small so when you come don't be in a hurry, it's worth the wait."
One Dim Sum,4,"really good quality, those fried football shaped ones are helllla good, too bad not much meat inside them."
Simplylife Bakery Cafe,4,"Last order for lunch set is at 2:30 pm. I was seated at 2:15 pm and the waitress came quickly to take the order. The soup of the day was mushroom soup , and the salad 's portion is quite big for an appetizer. Each comes with a piece of bread and butter. I ordered truffle pasta as main, and it was quite tasty. My friend ordered Full Day Breakfast and the portion is real generous. At the end we ordered two piece of cake, the chocolate jaffa pie and strawberry cheesecake, and as always, the cakes are to go for. The texture is firm and not too ""sickly""sweet. My favourite is always chocolate banana pie, sorta like a banofee, and with nutella in it. It is quite spacious and if you sit by the ...bench ( where you overlook the ice rink), do bring a jacket, it can be a bit chilly sitting there~"
Simplylife Bakery Cafe,3,Nothing special honestly. For the price it was a decent portion and both the cheeseburger and Avocado Sandwich was decent. There's only about 5 items on the menu but that's understandable for a bakery that centers on pastries rather than entrees. The avocado sandwich blends really well with the tomatoes and I wish there was more sausage on it. The coleslaw was very average and the cheeseburger was tasty but not exciting. Their mixed berry tea is basically 檸檬茶. Overall I would maybe come back to see if there are some improvements to their menu and overall taste. The food is pretty mediocre and there are definitely better choices in this area. But if you're craving western cuisine it's not a best choice.
Simplylife Bakery Cafe,3,"I have such conflicted feelings about this place.  on one hand, it's easy, cheap & generally good enough.  On the other, the service sometimes wants me to pull our hair out.  It is in essence fast food factory masquerading as a restaurant.  Food gets pumped out, and if there's any snags in the line - well, get ready because they can't really cope. Food options are pretty static across the brunch, lunch & dinner menus.  I've been here for afternoon tea and the quality def takes a hit.  Overall, good option for a quick, no fuss meal.  Cakes & coffee always are always great."
Simplylife Bakery Cafe,5,"Simplylife is my favorite place to dine for Western food in Hong Kong. Not only is it convenient since it was located right next to my university, but it is also delicious! Lunch, afternoon tea, desserts, or dinner? I have tried it all! Expect long queues for dinner and lunch, so I suggest to either have a really early or late meal to bypass the lines. My favorite time to go was for afternoon tea. It was the best deal because for about 100hkd you can get a meal and a nice cappuccino/latte. They have pretty juicy burgers and sandwiches that filled my stomach. I'm not a big eater, so this was the perfect size meal for me.Lunch and dinner are a bit pricier, as to be expected, but portions are huge so you'll get full. I suggest the chicken breast and the pizza because its delicious!The desserts are amazing! For my birthday, my friends ordered a cake and an array of pastries from here. Their desserts are all very light and not too sweet. I love how they combine an assortment of fruits and make it match on the desserts. I would recommend trying the tarts because they're quite unique and delicious."
Simplylife Bakery Cafe,4,"So my visits to HK usually lasts over a month, and while HK foods is delicious and fun, I do miss American food.I really didn't know what to expect when my aunt told me we were having tea time at simply life inside a mall. Egg tart? Milk tea?When I got there, my party was already seated, so I just went inside. As I got near the table, I passed by a glass case full of delicious beautiful dessert (I'll be back for this, I thought)We set down, and I took a look at the menu....""BACON CHEESE BURGER?? HELL YEAH!!!""And that was exactly what I ordered, how American of me right? Yeah, yeah, I know. I didn't expect much though, I just wanted my cravings to go away. IT WAS SO DELICIOUS.I must say, the ingredients and quality is really up to par here, even though it's located inside a mall. My other family members got different things, but I was just busy with my burger. The patty was not dry, the cheese was prefectly melted cheddar, and I think the bacon might have been applewood? I don't know, but it was thick cut. And it came with fries and the drink of the day (orange black iced tea). I don't know much about the price, I didn't pay. But I would definitely come back!"
Simplylife Bakery Cafe,1,"Simply life is simply crapOverpriced, weak coffee, subpar food and incompetent management."
Simplylife Bakery Cafe,4,This restaurant is my go to however here are pretty long line ups. Either have an early lunch or late lunch. Remember not to skip the dessert because it's bomb!! Service is lacking so minus one star
Simplylife Bakery Cafe,4,"Fun fact: when I met up with a friend and told her that we could go to Simply Life, she thought it was a furniture store.I don't blame her though, it really does sound like a modern lifestyle store! But that aside, Simply Life is actually a cafe that serves western food. It's got a couple of branches including at Festival Walk, Queensway and Tai Koo Shing - in my experience, it's the one at Festival Walk that's always the most crowded. I have had both lunch and afternoon tea here a few times, and what I love is that they have a lot of choices to choose from. They have anything from a hearty English breakfast to a mushroom beef burger to pasta in cream sauce! The lunch and afternoon tea set menus are very similar, so needless to say the afternoon tea sets are incredibly filling.All sets at Simply Life come with their daily iced tea, which is usually summery stuff like peach tea or passionfruit tea. I find their teas refreshing, but for example, I don't find the peach tea very peachy nor the passionfruit tea very, well, passionfruit-y. The set menus don't change very often, and one of my favorite mains here is the spring chicken. It's very tender and nicely flavored with herbs, and not too salty. The burgers here are pretty good too - if I'm here for tea and it's on the menu, I'll usually get it. They have different kinds and they all come with a side order of either regular or spicy fries. Once, I ordered the regular fries but was given the spicy instead. I didn't want to return it so I just had it, and it wasn't very spicy - but that may be because I swept most of the powdered seasoning off. My mother adores the big breakfast here - it's got a little bit of bacon, eggs, toast and the like and everything tastes very fresh.Every time I walk into Simply Life, I pass by all the pastries and the cakes and they look simply delightful. They've got tons of danishes and tarts, and I've been meaning to try one for a while now!Simply Life loses a star for its 24/7 ridiculously long queue. My mother likens it to a line for an amusement park ride. There's no avoiding the queue, but come by on weekdays - and early too, if you're here for lunch - and there will be less of a wait!"
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,5,"It's HK traditional street food, don't expect squeaky clean place BUT They have remodeled and it's now much cleaner and new.  Lost its old HK ghetto style. O well.  The rice roll is still the best I've had here in HK. Then of course I didn't try all of them but you can't go wrong. Also ordered the 艇仔粥(sampan).  Nothing stand out but pleased."
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,4,"You can order Cheung Fun pretty easily without Cantonese but some cantonese recommended if you want some other dishes.Cheung Fun (5/5) with peanut and hoisin sauce was delicious. We ordered it with stewed turnips and pork skin (4.5) and fish balls (3.5/5) to balance out the flavors and it's been one of my favorite local meals here. This place is a small hole in the wall place but it was packed even at night and I can definitely understand why. Cheung Fun, which they're known for, is essentially a rice roll and comes with a very unique sauce here. You can add spices and other sauces and sesame seeds here to add flavor to your liking. The flavor can get overpowering so we ordered it with stewed pork skin and turnips and fish balls. The stewed pork skin and turnip here was delicious also and was a nice way to give your palette a break from the strong sauce. Same with the fish balls, which you can probably find better on random street stalls but were passable and really help add some balance to your meal.Definitely a recommended location if you want a more unique snack in Hong Kong."
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,4,"One of several good snack shacks near Shum Shui Po MTR station.Bee-line for silky smooth Cheung Fun and a concoction of Peanut Sauce, Sweet Sauce, Soy Sauce, Hot Sauce and Oil to your liking.  A sprinkle of sesame seeds tops off this delicious Cheung Fun.Get it to-go in a bag or cramp inside with a plate."
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,4,"The whole area around this eatery is quite run down and smells like sewage, but it's all part of the HK street food experience! If you can overlook that, you're good to go :) Most people order from the take out window outside, but we managed to find some seats inside and shared the table with random people. I wouldn't say the cheung fun was the best that I have ever eaten, but i was still quite satisfied. The waitress was nice enough to accommodate our request of putting the sauces in a separate bowl for us due to my allergies with the sesame sauce. The siu mai was okay....I've had better and bigger ones elsewhere in HK and back home in Canada. Still satisfying though...no complaints!The century egg congee (皮蛋瘦肉粥) was pretty good with huge chunks of century egg and pork. Congee was nice and creamy as a proper congee should be."
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,3,"Um... it's okay I guess? It honestly didn't live up to my expectations considering it's Michelin recommended.Ordered a medium plate of cheung fun (rice noodle rolls) and siu mai. You can order the rice rolls in 3 diff amounts - S,M,L. Classically, they come topped with soy sauce, sesame paste, sweet hoisin-like sauce, and (optional) hot sauce. They are soft and smooth rolls... but they were a little thicker than what I enjoy. The siu mai is totally mehhhh. Tastes more like a starch filler on the inside. But for the price, what can you expect?The line up moves extremely fast though as the ladies who work here are super efficient! They have a couple small tables and stools inside BUTTT.... it's a cool experience to eat while standing on a street. So like the locals, I would recommend clumsily standing and holding your plate while attempting to take pictures hehe.Would I come back? Probably not... it wasn't outstanding."
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,5,This gem is in a corner of an alley. Inside the small shop was packed with customers. And they have customers standing outside eating as well. They are known for their plain rice noodle with peanut & hoisin sauce. Which is one of my favorite when I go to dim sum in the state. It doesn't not look nice when you buy it to go to eat. Very decent price for a large order. You get what you pay for.
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,4,"This local joint specializes in Chee Cheong Fun. For those who doesn't know what it is, Chee Cheong Fun is a steam rice noodle roll (Cantonese dish from southern China,commonly served during breakfast or as a snack). It is a thin roll made from a wide strip of shahe fen (rice noodles) and serve plain with sweet soy sauce, sesame sauce and Hoisin sauce.  Chee cheong means pig intestine, and fun means noodle; this is because the noodle is rolled more tightly and resembles the small intestine of a pig. No sweat, this is totally vegetarian friendly. Two common Cantonese words are typically used to describe a well-made rice noodle roll: ""heung"" (香) - meaning: good aroma and ""whaat"" (滑) - meaning: smooth or slippery. The actual noodle by itself doesn't have much taste, it is just as bland as plain white steamed rice. The fillings and the soy sauce that accompanies it provides the bulk of the flavor. Anyhow, I came here on a Thursday afternoon around 5pm and there was already a line in front of the restaurant. Everyone basically orders the same thing which is the Chee Cheong Fun. I usually don't enjoy plain carbs like this but the Chee Cheong Fun here is very silky and chewy. This is a local joint on a busy street adjustment to a local street market. Just to set the right expectations:1. Expect to share a table with someone if you have a small party (4 people and under)2. People may be standing behind you waiting for you to finish your food because seating is first come first serve. 3. You gota fight for a table on your own cuz the staff are too busy cooking. 4. There is no English menu so pointing is your best bet. It comes in small, medium and large sizes. Enjoy !!"
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,5,"I ordered 1 small plate at first. I came back shortly after for a round 2. Yeah--it's that good! AND it's super affordable! This place is a gem! The hoisin sauce, peanut sauce and sesame seeds aren't salty like other places I've encountered. It's absolutely perfect!!!"
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,2,The place is just too dirty. Rice roll is expensive. Overhyped by foodies on social network
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,5,"Perfect cheong fen, fresh chewy goodness. All sauces at will! You get hoisin, sesame, and light soya sauce on a regular order and can add some heat if you want. You can either take them from the cart outside on the street and eat them standing outside, take away, or order inside. Personally I didn't know how it worked so I ordered outside and took my order inside but that was OK for them. Order small medium or big plate, I ordered in mandarin and they understood perfectly."
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,5,"Fantastic cheung fun at awesome prices. It cost my friend and I $9 for 6 rolls, and that was enough for us to share. The rolls come with a choice of sauces mixed together: thick sesame oil (so thick it almost resembles and has the richness of peanut oil with a little peanut butter mixed in), a red sauce my friend called 'Cantonese catchup', and a dark oyster-style sauce. On top are sesame seeds. You can perch in the shop's diminutive interior, stand around in the alleyway to eat your steaming cheung fun from the plate with long toothpicks, or you can ask the server to get it to go, and it will be placed on a sheet of wax paper inside a plastic bag, to keep all the good juices in. The place serves other things like siu mai and fried noodles, but I only tried the cheung fun. I've been craving more since."
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,5,"Man, this was good. I've never really craved or paid too much attention to cheung fun (it's basically a thin sheet of rice-flour that is steamed and rolled up), but this just put cheung fun on the top of my to-eat HK street food. For HK$7, you get a good portion of cheung fun with a variety of sauces (sweet, sesame, soy sauce) that's good as a snack to share between 2 people. The shop itself is tiny, and there's also a takeout section that had a pretty long line when I went on the weekends (although it turned out not to be too long of a wait). The cheung fun came out steaming hot, and so so silky and smooth - the condiments help flavor it nicely. And even though cheung fun by nature doesn't really have much flavor, the ones here have that slight aromatic rice aroma. So delicious!! We ended up devouring the dish in the alley right beside the takeout counter, typical HK style; wouldn't have it another way."
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,4,"If you come to Hong Kong, authentic steamed rice rolls are hard to find, they can only be found in local places only the locals would know.  My cousin took me here, no ""qwie Los"" here unless it got recommended by a friend.  Sharing table is the norm in places like this.  Grab any seat you can.  They have 3 sizes for the steamed rice rolls, small, medium, and large at affordable prices.  It is freshly made and tasted very soft, you can add as much sauce as you want.  We also tried the noodles in soy sauce, this was ok, nothing special.  They also have fresh warm soy milk.  There is another steam rice roll place in Sai Kung, it's authentic there too.FYI: no need to tip in HK, but if you want to give your money away, give it to me."
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,5,"I.... Love... Their ..... Zhuchangfen猪肠粉. They sell it by the noodle, minimum of 4 at 2hkd each. We ordered 10hkd worth and it was such a good small snack, topped with sesame seeds. HK CLASSIC."
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,5,I am hooked on Cheung Fun ( rice noodles) now...this place is so goodThe sauces are perfect !.. I wish they had this back in Los Angeles
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,5,"Oh yes! 豬腸粉!! Steamed rice rolls with ""hella"" sauces!When thinking about 豬腸粉, some Depeche Mode song lyrics come to mind IMMEDIATELY.Martin Gore is a f**king genius, he can even be singing about Hong Kong food and he will make me swoon.Just Can't Get Enough: ""When I'm with you baby, I go outta my head, I just can't get enough! I just can't get enough"". (OK Vince Clarke wrote this one, it's ok.)Blue Dress: ""Put it on, and don't say a word, put it on, the one that I prefer"" ""Can you believe, something so simple, something so trivial, makes me a happy man, can't you understand. Just how easy it is to please me.""Yes I simply cannot get enough of 豬腸粉! And in reference to the Blue Dress lyrics....PUT IT ON, refers to the various mixed sauces that is a pre-requisite! Soy sauce, drizzle of lard or soy bean oil, TOASTED SESAME SEEDS, sweet sauce, sesame sauce, chili sauce. YES PUT IT ALL ON!!!! I'm the type of guy that needs lots and lots of sesame seeds in his 豬腸粉.豬腸粉 may not be one of those cool snacks like macarons or pork belly steamed buns, but it is an iconic food representative of Hong Kong food culture, and holds very dear to my heart. Probably something many westerners won't understand, unless they are fanatical about Vietnamese food, and know what ""banh cuon"" is all about.At Hop Yik Tai 合益泰小食, the best experience is to locate the storefront, and just look for the line.Have some coins ready, and know exactly how many rolls you want. Tell the lady, who will then pick up the required number of steamed rolls you want, then take a pair of scissors to snip into small bite sized pieces (or SLURP size pieces really), over a piece of wax paper on top of a plate. Then you decide on the sauces. For me, ""EVERYTHING!"" and ""SESAME SEEDS PLEASE!"". After you achieve your goal of securing a plate of the goods, move to the side, and stand in the alleyway to pick up the cut rolls with the wooden skewer sticks. Bring it to your mouth and SLURP it over.Be sure you are not wearing white, in case you make a mess in the process ;-).Yes the 豬腸粉 are not made on the premise, they are outsourced to a local vendor, but made fresh over there and brought over to Hop Yik Tai to steam. What HYT does in addition is create their own set of sauces, and that pretty much completes the circle.Well words fail sometimes...but once you've had microwaved or pre-refrigerated 豬腸粉 in the USA, store bought sauces (with chemicals and preservatives), it just does not compare to what HYT does. Smooth, slippery, and just insanely addictive. If I were an animal I would probably devour two orders...but if you are doing a food crawl (""sweeping the streets"") then one order is enough for a sample, or a quick fix.I swear this stuff is like doing drugs, or a cheap B&G (blow and go), and in the alleyway no doubt. :-oLonging for the day that I return to visit HK again, and Hop Yik Tai will forever be a must-stop for me."
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,4,One of the better rice noodle roll places I could find in Hong Kong (the good ones are getting difficult to find these days).
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,5,best cheung fun ever! so hard to describe but it's something have to try! the cheung fun are just made to perfection with perfect amount of sauce. no area to eat but don't mind just standing around to eat this! wish could be back to eat it again !
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,5,"Still loving their cheung fun and turnip and pork skin stew even though they recently got a Michelin star. This tiny place however got super duper crowded because of the star and service was going downhill as they can't handle the customer load. I just hope they won't get kicked out of their shop by the landlord because they got famous.Came here for the aforementioned cheung fun (rice rolls) and pork skin and turnip stew. The line for takeaway/ eat and go cheung fun was wrapped around the building. We lined up while hoping for a spot inside the tiny shop because wife really recommends the stew but you can only get it inside. We got lucky and wife used her HK skills to get us seats. As long as you can sit your butt on a stool, you have a seat. We got the Cheung fun with the sweet sauce, sesame sauce, sweet soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Came out piping hot and you can smell the rice flavor. The turnip in the stew was sweet and the soup was full of turnip flavor while the pork skin soaks up all this goodness."
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,3,"The rice rolls here are very smooth but growing up eating rice rolls from Macau, I am partial to the flavors from home.  (Can you believe even rice rolls have local flavors?)  I heard the take-out side makes better rice rolls but I have yet to try and confirm the statement.  Regardless, the portions are huge compared to the price they charge you so it still makes a good snack in the afternoon (or breakfast for that matter)!"
Hop Yik Tai Snacks,4,"Want the best churng fun (rice noodles) in HK?! This is the spot! Seats are first come, first serve and you share tables with randoms. The lady comes by to take your order so know what you want quick and then pay on the way out on the left. They also have a long time daily for the rice noodles to-go but we wanted to get the authentic feel or eating with locals and enjoying it sitting down. The cold soy milk was the perfect sweetness; light sweetness to still taste the soybeans. You MUST order the medium rice noodle (comes in three sizes) for four. You use the condiments in the middle of the table to flavor your noodles; we used hot sauce and lots of sesame! The daikon is also very sweet and delicious!! Another must! We also had the curry fish balls but I liked it least of all the small orders. Perfect for a snack while walking around and shopping. 38RMB for two soy milks, curry fish balls, medium rice noodles, and daikon (~$5 USD). Definitely recommend and will be back!"
EXP,4,"The seating is pretty nice, open air to shopping area but secluded area from the shoppers.This soft shell crab salad is satisfying. With slightly spicy salad dressing, some chilli on top of a variety of greens and fried goodies.The laksa is a bit pricey and with limited amount of bean curd, shrimp, sprout beansfish ball and half an egg. Quite spicy this one. This is next to the GLACIER skating rink, so there were parents sitting eating, waiting their kids to come and eat after their skating session.This restaurants offers freshly squeezed juice. There is a Take away juice bar too."
EXP,4,"A good dining option if you don't feel like eating mall food at the Festival Walk mall. Located near the ice skating rink. While dining here you'll get a great view of people ice skating. They serve mainly Italian food like pizza, pastas and salads. My favorite is the black ink pasta with scallops. The taste and flavor is comparable to the one I had in Venice. I've also tried the pizza and salad which were also very delicious. Friendly servers. Don't worry if you don't speak Cantonese. The servers speak English too so no worries about that."
EXP,4,"I was pleasantly surprised.A bit expensive, but a notch higher in term of quality. I had the squid ink sauce spaghetti with scallops.It was well done, the spag was aldente and the sauce was creamy. The scallops were perfectly cooked and plump.If you're in a pinch and need something quick yet delicious. That's your place."
EXP,3,"This is by far the most popular restaurant in festival walk due to its pricing and food options. They serve a good variety of options ranging from pizza, pasta, satays, fries to laksa, pomelo shrimp salad. There is always a line so i would suggest getting a number in advance using the food gulu app. This place is located right to the the ice-skating rank and serve lunch, afternoon tea and dinner menu. They also have freshly squeezed juice if you are looking for a quick juice to go option."
EXP,4,"Second time back for good comfort food. This time around we got the smoked salmon red onion flatbread pizza, pineapple ham pizza, cheesy kimchi fried rice and Japanese tonkatsu over rice. Place has a casual vibe with an indoor ice rink next door. Each dish is well proportioned and super yummy. Actually the pizzas were huge and had to pack up to go (midnight snack).  This place isn't cheap and they charge 10% gratuity. Our bill came to $402HKD for 4 dishes."
Greyhound Cafe,4,"""You're my real boss, not him in black suit.""""Life is too short. More dessert, anyone?""These and other sassy sayings can be read on the staff uniforms at Greyhound Cafe at Festival Walk, giving anyone who walks in the idea that you are in for a fun dining experience. Described as Italian and Thai with a twist, this place spices up life by combining the spicy flavors of Thai food and heartiness of Italian pasta dishes... And that's just getting started! In addition to some unique entrees like spicy Thai spaghetti you can also find a variety of burgers, noodle and soup dishes that meet this fun, sassy style of food Greyhound has going on. I particularly like their lunch sets (HK$88 or HK$98) depending on which entree you get which also include a soup or salad. For only HK$20 more you can get a drink or a dessert too! I've gone with a group of colleagues for lunch and it took a little bit for everything to come out however when I was flying solo lunch came out almost instantly.Pro-tip: take the lift to L2 to save some time because it's a lot of escalators up if you choose to go up each level."
Greyhound Cafe,2,"Small dishes, rather flavorless and requested no scallions twice and remade my food with scallions anyways a second time."
Greyhound Cafe,4,"This is a fusion restaurant where it serves Asian cuisine as well as western cuisine. I came with my relatives and we had a company of 12 people. We ordered different small dishes to share. They served a variety of dishes, ranged from Vietnamese to Western style dishes. Although we tasted a bit if everything, We did have a variety of experience. In general, the dishes tasted good. I am especially impressed by the coconut dessert. It's quite refreshing and light."
Greyhound Cafe,4,"I really liked the food here. Wasn't sure what to expect when we arrived but it's located in the top level of Festival Walk mall and was pretty busy when we went. The place served Fusion Food. We ordered the curry, the seafood pasta, some skewers, the crispy rice, and chicken wings. Everything was really good. The drinks were very tasty as well (including the Passion Fashion which looked really pretty too) Also loved the dessert. Definitely try the coconut crepe cake. Fresh whipped cream and real coconut pieces. What's not to love?!"
Greyhound Cafe,4,"There have been quite a few Greyhound Café around Hong Kong and yet this one at Festival Walk stole my heart. The one in Tsim Sha Tsui though has a breathtaking Victoria Harbour view, yet it seems rather packed and unorganized (not to mention all those tourists with luggage all over the place - it is rather 'hellish'); the one in IFC on the other hand did not really impress me much with its dishes - they tasted all right; the one in Mong Kok was newly opened so I might try that in the future - just give its staff a bit more time to get their hands on things.The first time I went there was because a friend of mine told me about the Thai milk tea here. You know how much Hongkongers love to drink milk tea with bubble tea shops in front of you literally everywhere you go. Therefore, I decided to give it a go. I have to warn others though, as much as I love this Thai milk tea, it is rather sweet; if you are one of those that need to order less sweet in one of those bubble tea places, it might not suit you well. Anyhow, I genuinely love the sweetness of it - very refreshing and silky.As for the food, it serves Thai slash western food. Kind of original to have both Chow Mein and burgers on our tables. And the best part - it is not overly-priced. As for the décor, the black and white together with the greyhound logo match quite perfectly. I highly recommend the one at Festival Walk. As for the milk tea, try it and see if that is too sweet for you."
Greyhound Cafe,4,"For a million years I couldn't imagine myself dining in this restaurant, judging from the decor and the locale, you can tell right away its a high-end restaurant. As I am usually a lone diner, expensive restaurants as such would never be my choice. Thanks to the group of friends that suggested having dinner here was I been able to taste out this restaurant.Although claiming to be a thai restaurant, it is more fusion to me; other than the more common thai dishes like tom yum soup and fried vermicelli, it also serves dishes like pasta and potato wedges. I quite enjoy the pasta dishes we ordered, I especially like the use of fresh pepper corn and dried chili which spiced up the otherwise quite ordinary pasta. The snacks were also quite enjoyable. Besides the potato wedges with aioli, the fried shrimp with spices as well as the shrimp pancakes with corn kernel were very nice. Oh and i have to talk about the drinks; they have their own specialty drinks including floral tea, milk tea and lemongrass drink. For people who enjoy a little exoticism in a cup, it would be a delight to see a drink list as such.I would very much urge you to save some room for desserts and cakes after the entree ; but popular as the glutinous with mango they often get sold one during dinner service in weekends, so make sure u place your order ahead of time~"
Greyhound Cafe,3,"Deciding to go to Greyhound usually falls under one of two narratives for me: 1. The line wasn't ridiculously long this time, so you thought ""might as well"" (usually applies to Festival Walk branch); and 2. We didn't make our reservations to so-and-so, and this was the only place around we could collectively agree on (usually applies to Central branch).  My most recent trip was for reason 1, as I finished work in Kowloon Tong the other day at around 9pm.  I didn't expect anywhere to be open (I thought I was in London for a second, not Hong Kong - the city that never sleeps), but spotted School Food and Greyhound still taking people in.  Greyhound had less wait-time and no queue since School Food had just opened around here.  Score!I actually think Greyhound deserves more credit than it's given.  The food is not half bad.  Their noodle dishes could use some work - like their vermicelli with brisket and beef balls, which has a strong flavor that isn't necessarily palatable...But, I enjoyed their appetizer of tenderloin with a green pesto using Thai basil instead of Italian basil.  I thought that was very smart, and it worked so well.  We also tried their chicken wings the last time I went, which were shaped a little unconventionally and tasted a little dry, but had a good enough flavour that we finished the generously-portioned plateI would return if I ever found myself in a similar situation in Festival Walk, as there are too few dining options around here."
Greyhound Cafe,1,"Have a try on this new fusion Thai cafe, overall all environment is good. Food quality is alright. However, there has time limitation during dinner time, which I did not expected. Sit down with my FD and got kicked out within 30 mins is quiet ruin the mood"
Greyhound Cafe,1,"Service there is horrifying, rude waiters, low quality food, and overcrowded and overpriced. So it was a normal Saturday at around 8 pm, we ordered a meals for ourselves and one meal took 2 hours long, during those two hours, we kept asking waiters what's taking them so long, but all they ever did was telling us that it is still on the way, and when we got tired (not feeling hungry and in the mood anymore), they finally told us that the machine apparently ""broke down"", but in reality I'm certain that they did not bother taking down the order, and still didn't bother when we asked them about it. Overall the experience at greyhound was detrimental and terrifying, the belligerence of the staff and lack of effort and enthusiasm is not acceptable. Even your neighbouring restaurant pizza express is much better and satisfying. Terrible terrible service, I will never ever come again, and I definitely not recommend this disgusting place. TL;DR - terrible terrible service, low quality food, staff acts like dead lifeless fishes, horrible experience, not coming back again."
Greyhound Cafe,5,Great fusion w ASIA countries. My favourate is the Thai milk tea which is not common jn they his restaurants
The Alchemist Cafe Bistro,4,"A travel-themed restaurant?  I'm in!Alchemist Cafe Bistro.. oh how did I ever forget about you?  I remember coming here for Couch Surfing meetups when I first moved to Hong Kong.  I remember liking the place, but was only ever here for drinks.  I guess forgetting about this place has a lot has to do with the restaurants location, being nowhere close to anywhere I usually frequent. Recently wanted to eat something in Price Edward because I rarely ever go there, and I found this old friend on Yelp!  Came here on a Saturday afternoon, and was surprised how packed this place was.  Even though we arrived at a time after the  usual lunch rush (around 2pm) we still had to wait a good 30 mins. I really like the decor in this place.  The restaurant is plastered with travel-theme everywhere.  Such as posters, items, and souvenirs all around.  I wonder if the owner actually collected all these items on their travel?  Anyway, its very cool to see a little part of the world every corner you look.  In the middle of the restaurant there's also a mini stage, which I guess musicians perform at on certain days.  On the corner seats, there's a big tv showing videos of the performers.  Overall, the vibe of this restaurant is very nice.  For the food, they have a decent variety of western food available.  We ended up trying the cheese shrimp pasta and the chicken yogurt pita sandwich.  We ordered these because its a little different than another typical western restaurant.  The pasta was pretty good!  Not overly cheesy.  But I was disappointed with the pita.  The sandwich was just way too bland, and the mini salad that came with it was also bland.  Both meals were lunch sets which included a drink and bread + soup.  The bread and soup were both decent. Although Alchemist Cafe is a little out of the way for me normally, I think I will return some more in the future to try some of their other dishes."
The Alchemist Cafe Bistro,3,"Came here a dinner, friends recommended this place, so we went there as a group of 4. Located is hidden in an alley, for me, it's not quite easy to find and this is full of car modeling shops around. You can easily spot this café as this is the only one have people waiting for seats outside. They do not accept any reservations so my friend went there early to try to get a seat. She waited for 15 mins and we got in. Décor is amazing. This is about the owner love to travel so open a shop with all the décor of post card, books and souvenirs all around the world. They do not have a wide selection of menu but all the price are very reasonable. For $100, you can have a soup and main. And all the dishes there is around $100 and the portion is very big enough for 2 people. We ordered 2 sets(fish and fries & Roasted rice with cream sauce), and 2 al carte from the menu (snacks platter & assorted steak).  Definitely recommend the fish and fries, the fish are fried perfectly, and size are at least 20cm by 10 cm! We are all impressed with this great deal! And the snack flatter are in great portion(at least 20 pieces of everything) and we got all very excited. Even though it's all sausages, potatoes fedges, onion rings, deep fried curry, stuffed Crab Claw and it's out of my healthy rating, this is just very nicely plated and great taste.I saved some space for dessert and ordered waffle with green tea ice-cream,  waffle are freshly made and yes, I do love it. The bill is only $750 for 4 and I am so full after all!"
The Alchemist Cafe Bistro,2,"2nd visit in 2 years.English breakfast is great!!  Reuben sandwich is not (not enough meat).They don't sell condensed milk on toast anymore !!!!!!  ;(.  Why not ?!?The service is so so. As a tourist, travellers Cafe.....I hoped the my server would speak a little English but no, she didn't. Looks like this place is under new ownership (just a guess) and is being run by a group of friends that own the place and are trying to make a business.... I dunno....  the servers were young adults... they  didn't smile, were not polite or professional. In a 'western' style cafe that has English memorabilia everywhere, you would think they would try to provide great customer service but NO.My Reuben sandwich came with fries. I asked my server for ketchup (tomatoes sauce). She pointed to a counter and said ""there"" and walked away.  I had to get up and get it myself. I was so surprised!!The fruity drinks that come with the set meals were the highlight for me.Feedback: Better customer service and experience = more spending and positive word of mouth."
The Alchemist Cafe Bistro,4,Love this place! Offers variety of delicious food and an Amazing cappuccino! You have to try it. Love to come here and work.
The Alchemist Cafe Bistro,4,"Travel books filled the shelves that lined the wall. A mix of cafe, industrial, and spot light fixtures stylishly flooded the space with a warm hue. The brushed cement walls made the whole restaurant looked like a cave or a tunnel through the small entrance. The soft pop music in the background was just distinguishable over the voices of the diners chatting about their days while breathing in the relaxed atmosphere. The waiters were courteous and fairly attentive. The beverages that they brought were creative and interesting. If only the food was of equal standard, this restaurant would have made my top ten list! The food was decent, and I particularly enjoyed the salad, but the main courses were unimpressive except for being already cooled when served. The food also arrived at widely different times so that a few of us were already done before the rest of us were served at all.  Nevertheless, a very pleasant dinner. 4 stars."
The Alchemist Cafe Bistro,5,This is a nice little British style restaurant. If you're visiting Hong Kong but just need a little taste of Western food this is a great place with some awesome salmon based meals. Great tea selection too! The tea has its own multi paged menu.Went there twice on my trip and would go back if I ever travel to Hong Kong again.
The Alchemist Cafe Bistro,4,"I love the interior here. It has a travel theme to it, and word has it you can also trade travel stuff here for a discount.The cafe also makes decent priced cocktails (protip: The cocktails are actually better value than the beer).If you're also traveling or want to meet new friends also, the weekly couchsurfing party is hosted here every Saturday where there is at least 20-30 people some local and some travelers passing through."
The Alchemist Cafe Bistro,1,Service is complete shit. The waiters just stand around and are useless. Had to get up and ask the manager after 30 min if someone could take my order and just left $ on table o pay as no one would bring me a bill.
The Alchemist Cafe Bistro,4,"It is a really good place to go, although may kind of crowded because of the large population in HK. Tasty food and good beer."
The Alchemist Cafe Bistro,5,One of my favourite places in Kowloon. The Alchemist is my fix away from the office away from the office in Australia. Fantastic coffee. Brilliant food. Mostly western style food but they do it so well unlike most of Hong Kong. Decent portion sizes. Free wifi. Great service.
The Alchemist Cafe Bistro,5,I like the style of the restaurant. I like their food. Great atmosphere .  Great for couples or group of friends gathering!
Wai Kee Noodle Cafe,5,"I absolutely LOVE Pig's Liver, and if you share the same enthusiastic feeling I get eating them, then this is a priority place to go! They have other options of meat if you cannot stomach Pig's Liver, but you can get that at any Cha Caan Teng place. Their Kaya French Toast (咖椰西多) is delicious though, so many people would order both the Pig's Liver + Beef Noodle (豬膶牛麵) and the Kaya French Toast.This place does not have an English Menu (from my experience) .. so bring someone who can speak the language or at least read the basic Chinese characters. OR... find a translation using the phone and show it to the waiter in hopes they understand.Be aware that you will sit with someone as a lot of people also enjoy this place, so make sure you fight for those seats! (Just kidding, please don't fight). The restaurant seems small, but they have another space right next door."
Wai Kee Noodle Cafe,4,"I happened to be in the Sham Shui Po area with a friend (after buying some electronic supplies at the arcade and street market), so I thought I'd give Wai Kee a try, as another friend recommended them for their beef and pork liver noodles. We had a bit of difficulty finding Wai Kee at first as the address was vague. We later found that there are 3 shops all along the same side of the street, all with people lined up outside - this was around 4pm! As my friend and I don't eat pork liver, we just opted for the regular beef noodles. It came out nice and piping hot - a definite good sign. The broth was tasty with the cooked beef, perfect for the winter cold. But I wasn't a big fan of the instant ramen noodles used, although typical of a local cha chaan teng. We also ordered the kaya toast which was absolutely delicious! It's essentially fried thick French toast with kaya (coconut jam) slathered in between. The woman sitting across from us (note: you WILL have to share tables), ordered her own after seeing ours, and had hers topped with condensed milk! People in HK like their food sweet, haha! Definitely worth the try if you're in the area, especially for the kaya toast!"
Wai Kee Noodle Cafe,5,"This is by far my favourite restaurant in the Sham Shui Po Area and sometimes when I happen to have cravings, I'll make my way here just for their food. So this places is always busy and there is a reason why. Their Pork Liver Instant Noodles 豬膶牛麵 and their Kaya Toast 咖椰多 or 咖椰西多. It is truly one of the many treasures in Hong Kong and their simplicity is probably the key to their success. Offer few items but do those few items so well no one else can do a better job. And here i'm really just referring to the Kaya french toast. When I'm trying to eat a little less oily i'll go for the Kaya Toast but we all know deep fried foods just taste so good. I compare Wai Kee to Australian Dairy Company in Jordan - both have specialized in a certain dish and stuck to their ways. The service is sometimes pretty mean but I'm willing to brush it off as people being busy."
Wai Kee Noodle Cafe,4,"Located near the Tsim Tsa Po area (good place to buy electronics and random gifts) is this store. There are two locations on the same street and I decided to head to the one next to 7Eleven as I was meeting one of my Hong Kong mates there.Before heading here, did little read ups on what's the famous dish here and pork liver noodle was ranked the highest. I ordered that with ice lemon tea on the side.My brother and I managed to be in line earlier and was ushered towards a back seat (near toilet) pretty quickly. Sometimes you would need to share tables with other customers but somehow we were given our own table.The noodle was springy and chewy. Perfectly cooked even though it was served within 5 minutes. The soup was tasty and warm when served. The slices pork liver was amazing. For this dish, you should consume it straightaway after being served. I waited awhile, thinking that I should cool it down first, and the taste and texture changed within 15 minutes. Due to being engrossed in conversations, I had to waste a few slice. Price wise it was pretty reasonable and I am glad that my friend recommended this place as it served different style of Hong Kong dishes. You could have macaroni instead of noodles here too. Even my brother who doesn't really like Hong Kong style dishes cleared up his bowl of mixed beef noodle ;)"
Wai Kee Noodle Cafe,4,"If it's pig liver noodle soup that you want, this is THE place to go.Being a huge fan of liver of all types (America's liver & onions to Asian onion exploding liver), it takes a lot to impress me. And Wai Kee Noodle Cafe blew past that expectation.There are at least four Wai Kee Noodle on the same street, but as far as I can tell, they are all the same. I didn't bother to try anything else but did see locals trying a variety of noodle soup dishes.The only reason I took one star off is they didn't quite clean the table between guests. Not that cleanliness is the #1 trait across HK restaurants, but a bit more effort would be appreciative (we brought our own wipes to wipe down the table)."
Wai Kee Noodle Cafe,3,"Very traditional spot for noodles/instant noodles/macaroni. This is definitely a no-frills place. I had the spam and beef instant noodles. They give you a good amount of meat, good size, and flavor was good. No complaints, and a place I would return to if I were in the area and craving for instant noodles."
Wai Kee Noodle Cafe,4,"OMG, these pig liver and beef ramen were so good, same as their homemade kaya french toast.  We got there at around 8 pm and surprisingly there was no line outside.  The liver was cooked perfectly. It was so tender and smooth.  They don't skimp on the portions either. There were plenty of liver and beef in the bowl. The broth could have been a little more salty.  But I'm not complaining.  I'm a fan.  Also a very reasonable price at $32 HKD,"
Wai Kee Noodle Cafe,4,"Is simplicity best, or simply the easiest?Answer: both.Too many restaurants cropping up all over the place. Everyone just wants to be cutting edge, doing something different. A few just end up emphasizing style over substance (and unfortunately many buy into the hype).Then you look at a place like Australia Dairy Company, or even this old school HK cafe, and lines form outside the door more or less throughout the day, and wonder....they must be doing something right.Sometimes you just need to do one thing right, and only that thing. And do it so bloody fecking well that nobody can replicate it. You become the expert and go-to for this. Wash, rinse, repeat, and become the undisputed champion.Of course it helps when you have been doing it for years. But you never stray from a commitment to quality and consistency, and that is the key point that many miss.維記咖啡粉麵 (Wai Kee Coffee and Noodle) has been a staple of Sham Shui Po for decades. Their flagship product offering is an ethereal and incredible pork liver soup, and their pork liver prep is also very solid.While they have other things on the menu similar to other HK cafes, they do the pork liver soup so well that if you do not try it here, you haven't really visited Wai Kee, or even Sham Shui Po area.These guys are so successful that they opened up two additional spaces on the same street to handle overflow and crowds (and all 3 locations have lines!).Pork liver is a rather challenging ingredient. Cook it too long and it becomes dry, chewy, and unappetizing. Undercook it and you are essentially flirting with danger if the product is not clean. And as fresh as you can get, there is always that taste that drives people away (kind of like how people dislike sheep and goat for being too gamey).Yet WK makes some truly amazing pork liver, and a rich deep lightly sweet pork liver broth that is indeed the stuff of legends. Their liver does not have that weird taste or aftertaste, and it is not just a matter of using ginger. Don't think anyone has been able to figure out their secret.Yes they have other offerings on the menu, but you really want to have a bowl of pork liver soup with either macaroni, rice noodles, or instant noodles. If you don't want pork liver slices, spam and egg is a safe choice. The broth will have some bubble/fat, it's not molecular cuisine, but is part of the flavor.Their iced coffee is good, way better than Australia Dairy Company.Another must have item is their french toast, with kaya jam (coconut based) on the inside. Simple food, comforting, yet done at such a ridiculously high level.Don't expect beck and call kind of service here. More like local style, no nonsense, efficient.They deserve their success and to some extent, arrogance if they want, since they have the quality to back it up."
Wai Kee Noodle Cafe,5,"One of the many treasures in the Po.  Wai Kee is the one I frequent the most and always get an itch to return when I am away for too long.  We even coined the term 「膶牛之友」(the friends of pork liver + beef) i.e., people who became friends over a bowl of pork liver & beef noodles! I always get the pork liver & beef w/ noodles (豬膶牛麵) plus a coffee + tea with condensed milk (鴦走) .  Once in a while, I will get the pork liver & sunny egg w/ noodles.  The portion is generous here.  Sometimes, even I have trouble finishing the entire bowl.  But other times, I will have room to fit in a slice of their french toast w/ kaya jam (咖椰西多) I am simply amazed by how consistent they get their livers to taste.  There was only one time where the liver didn't live up to par but as I have said earlier, I come here a lot so I will count that as an one time-exception"
Wai Kee Noodle Cafe,4,"This is one of my family's favourites, because it's simple, fast, and delicious. Well, it's only fast if you manage to avoid the lines because this place has gained quite a bit of popularity. Make sure you check both restaurant spaces -- they are disjoint but on the same street. Seating is available whenever there are enough chairs at a table, so you could be sitting with strangers.Their specialty is instant ramen noodles with pork liver and beef. You might go like ""who pays for instant ramen?!"", but the way they cook it, in their special broth, is definitely worth a try. The pork liver is always very fresh.Other things you should try: Kaya on toast (or on Hong Kong-style french toast if that's what you prefer), coffee + tea (yinyeung).The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it's definitely not a place for anyone to sit comfortably at for a long time... think street food style ;)"
Wai Kee Noodle Cafe,4,"Wai Kee Noodle Cafe Hong Kong 維記咖啡粉麵 is a tiny café serving foodies and locals with infamous pig liver instant noodles 馳名豬潤麵. Although they also offer French toast and jam toast, but it by no means draws in the crowds.Pig liver instant noodles 馳名豬潤麵 perhaps does not strike a common tourist as a destination as does Apliu Street market 鴨寮街 (for electronic items, batteries, Hi-Fi's and mobile phone knick knacks), nor Golden Shopping Centre 高登電腦中心 (for computer goods); nor even Pei Ho Street 北河街 (for street vendors and hawkers); but if you had a taste of its thinly sliced velvety liver than you too would part seas - ok, maybe not as dramatic.Beef Slice Noodles: blanched to just cooked perfection and floating in the same delicious clear broth as the pig liver noodles. I'm sure you would also enjoy this bowl of al dente noodles.Wai Kee Noodle Cafe Hong KongBear in mind this place is a dive and you are expected to pack sardines and share a table with 6 other people. Maybe not the best idea to come here after a full day of shopping in Sham Shui Po."
Wai Kee Noodle Cafe,4,"We came here based on Open Rice reviews. It was morning we didn't order any noodles; we just had egg toast and the French toast, along with a cup of lemon iced tea. The egg toast was literally bread with an egg-no flavor, no condiments, nothing. The French toast on the other hand, although sweet, was really good! Wished we had ordered two of those instead. The lemon iced tea was pretty good. So 4 stars just for the French toast and lemon iced tea."
Amaroni’s,5,"If you crave Italian food and big portions- this place does not disappoint. Amaroni's Little Italy has been in Festival Walk almost since the beginning and the shop is probably one of the best decorated Italian eateries in Hong Kong. As soon as you step in, the low lighting and the bar, to the photos on the wall seem to bring you back to the 1920/30s; you can also imagine yourself as Tony Soprano with your crewing dining out and discussing ""plans"". There are plenty of choices on the menu and you will really have to focus on deciding what you want as there seems to be options for every single dish. On my visit I had the lasagna, Caesar salad, meat ball spaghetti and a pizza which to this day I still have no idea what it is. A general comment would be: its no fine dining location but the portions and the presentation aims to impress. The lasagna was fine with good meaty bits and layers of pasta in between, the meat ball was no surprise (only surprise was that they were the size of tennis balls) and the salad was run of the mill.  Everything was well dressed and the complimentary bread basket was certainly a bonus for a table full of famished souls. The prices are relatively modest given that you are given huge portions for whatever you order. This place is also known for doing a full blown happy birthday with staff signing happy birthday to the birthday boy/girl whilst brining a cake- this will have to be arranged beforehand and I guess its not something you do spontaneously anyways. Would I come back? Yes, because sometime I just want a really fulfilling meal at reasonable prices."
Amaroni’s,2,"Came here because of the good reviews.  Maybe there's been a change in the kitchen staff, but the food was pretty awful. If you want anything resembling Italian food, Amaroni's is not it."
Amaroni’s,3,Yes. Only 1.5 hrs to dine and it's located in Festival Walk. I hope we can finish everything in such time frame.
Amaroni’s,3,"Haven't been here for years and suddenly crave for Italian food so we came to Amaroni after shopping at Festival Walk. We arrived around 8:45 without a reservation, got to the reception and were treated quite impolitely. The receptionist was rude when giving out a number to us. Told us we were no.36 while the next number to be called was no.15, and told us we need to wait outside. She couldn't tell us how long the wait would be. Although the message was informative, the tone of it was rude and unwelcoming. We saw there were only a few others waiting so we decided to wait. Soon enough we were seated before 9pm, probably most of no.15 thru 35 were turned away by the receptionist. Then the hostess seated us without any greetings.We ordered the Ravioli, Chicken Parmesan, and creamy baked potato chips. To our surprise the ravioli were served before we got our bread. Didn't mind the surprise at all coz it was quite delicious. The creamy tomato sauce was just right and very tasty. Then we got the baked potato chips, and our water soon after. Had to ask our server for bread again and got an impatience response. Then finally got our bread and Chicken Parmesan. The Chicken Parmesan was great! Portions were big but the two of us managed to chuck it all.The restaurant was very busy. We had to wait for a while for water refill and to get the bill. Overall, great food but poor service! Turned off by bad attitude receptionist and hostess, servers were just too busy to take care of too many tables."
2/3 Dolci,3,"Saw from the other's review that the cakes are great here. However I'm just too hungry this day I need a sanswich instead, which I could just rate as an OK only...haha...The ham and cheese sandwish is hot but nothing else. Maybe for this price I'd expect something more....I will try the cake and coffee next time...."
2/3 Dolci,4,"Situated on the level of Festival Walk that I call the 'half floor' (because it's just a small corner of the mall that kind of juts out), Dolci doesn't look like much. There's a counter where the cakes and gelato are displayed, and near it are a couple of tables and chairs. With the pretty display of artisanal cakes and pastries, Dolci looked really tempting. When my mother and I walked past, we decided to come back later in the afternoon.There aren't many tables there but lucky for us, there was exactly one vacant table when we arrived. We decided to get the set where you can mix and match any four mini gelato scoops and two cakes. The lady at the counter was very helpful and told us which were the more popular ones among customers. She even let me try all of the gelato flavors before deciding which to get! In the end, after a lot of pondering, we chose the Formaggio (blueberry cheesecake) and the Frutti di Bosco (berry chiffon cake). For the gelato flavors, everything I tried was so good but eventually I narrowed it down to hazelnut, pistachio, earl grey and a chocolate one that I don't remember the exact name of. I was basically in love with all of our picks. The cakes were very light and flavorful - my mother preferred the blueberry cheesecake one more while I liked the berry chiffon cake more (but when it came down to it, I adored both). And the gelatos - there wasn't a single one that I was disappointed with. When it comes to ice cream flavors, I often stick to the conventional ones like vanilla and cookies and cream, so picking pistachio and earl grey was a little out of my comfort zone, if you will. No regrets though! Even though they were mini scoops, they weren't too tiny, though of course I would've preferred more! However, the pistachio and chocolate flavors were a little too sweet for my liking, although they were still really good in my opinion.I will definitely be back at Dolci for more! Again, it's a little bit on the pricey side, but I really like how you get to mix and match to try a variety. How often can you go to a café and try two different cakes and four different ice cream flavors? Not very often at all!"
Lau Sum Kee Noodle,4,"Warning: No English Menu. Some Cantonese recommended.We came here at the recommendation of some locals and the place was delicious. They have multiple different styles of wonton and dumpling dishes and noodles and veggies and some other stuff. We got orders of wonton with shrimp roe noodles, dumplings with shrimp roe noodles. Both the Wonton noodles with Oyster Sauce (4/5) and shrimp roe (4.5/5) were really good, with a slight preference to the shrimp roe noodles. Plus they're more unique so I would definitely try them out. The difference between wontons and dumplings were that the dumplings are bigger while wontons you get more, but they were both good. Veggies with Oyster Sauce (3.5/5) were good too but very standard. Braised Beef Tendon was also good and recommended if you still have room left (4/5)."
Lau Sum Kee Noodle,4,"Absolute delight. If you happened to be in HK, this is one of the places that should be your destination. Been coming to here whenever I am in town. Nothing in the states could remotely compare to this. A couple of wonton noodles places in Vancouver and Toronto could be your best bet in North America. Yet find a place in US that is in the same league."
Lau Sum Kee Noodle,5,"OHMYGAAAAAA. These have got to be the yummiest bowl of wonton noodles I've had in my life. I guarantee you the next time I'm in HK, I will be eating this again. Don't know how I'll survive eating regular mediocre wonton noodles back home in TO now.  When we came during the weekend lunch hour, there was no wait and plenty of tables available. Service was good! The woman working there was friendly and does not rush you to order or finish. Be prepared to share your table with other patrons though - this is the norm! Ordered the:Shrimp roe noodle soup with wontons - Best bamboo noodles I've had so far! The texture is the bombdiggity! It's springy and al dente... just SO AMAZING. The soup is good and savoury, interesting enough it's actually kinda thick. The wontons are yummy little bite-sized pockets (not mammoth sized wontons like in TO HAHA). They do NOT skimp on the shrimp roe here, there's more than enough to coat each bite you take! Adds on a very nice shrimpy layer of flavour. Each table also has a huge jar of pickled veg. Not my thing but supposedly very good.Totally recommend coming here to Sham Shui Po... get yoself dis bowl of noodles and find some good deals on electronics while you're here!"
Lau Sum Kee Noodle,4,"Bamboo noodles have a springy texture far superior to any other egg noodle found in your average bowl of wonton noodle soup. Unfortunately this style of noodle making is also a dying art, with fewer and fewer places offering it. I've had the best bamboo noodles years ago in Guangzhou, from an old shop I can sadly no longer find, but luckily Lau Sum Kee serves up a close second. Lau Sum Kee is an old favorite, evident by the numerous photographs lining the walls of celebrities who have once visited. Fear not, it is far from touristy as it is located deep in Sham Shui Po. They are most popular for their shrimp roe noodles, which are served dry with a bowl of flavorful broth on the side. Whoever prepped my plate gave me a ton of shrimp roe! I also added tendon for six bucks, and it was a great combo as the tendon is very soft. Also sampled their wonton noodle soup, which wasn't as good. Their wontons, although full of shrimp, lack the ""snap"" that is crucial to any good wonton. Best to pass this item and seek your wontons elsewhere in the city as this place sure won't satisfy your craving."
Lau Sum Kee Noodle,4,"The bamboo noodles, so called because of the  process making it, worked well with the beef tendon.  The portion size was somewhat small, but a picture of Anthony Bourdain outside is probably a good enough endorsement to try the wares."
Lau Sum Kee Noodle,4,"Pretty solid place. Make sure you check their hours before you come, they start at noon.  Portions are good, little bit of noodles w 5 wontons.  Hk style so don't be surprised if you're sharing tables. You can add a soda to your meal for $7."
Lau Sum Kee Noodle,5,"If you do one adventurous thing when visiting Hong Kong, please make your way here. The bamboo noodles served here is one of the last of its kind. It is a dying art-form to make bamboo noodles. Order the shrimp roe noodles with either tendon, beef tripe, or wonton. My favorite was the black tripe. Dip it into the accompanying soy sauce and enjoy!The current owner is the grandson of the original owner who brought this traditional method of making these egg noodles to Hong Kong from Guangzhou. Go eat this before this art completely dies out."
Lau Sum Kee Noodle,1,"I've put away yelping days only for the occasional amazingly good or bad places.I've had this place numerous times upon my visits to Hong Kong, but this time it has really left a bad taste in my mouth.There was no wait this time, but the restaurant was at 90% capacity. Ordered a dry mix shrimp roe wonton noodle with some beef brisket/tendon, a broad rice noodle with beef brisket/tendon in soup, a plate of water spinach (tung choi), a cream soda and orange fanta.I'm extremely fluent in Cantonese, my traveling partner heard me say what I said. But somehow the lady brought back a cola and Fanta, but refused to acknowledge that she made a mistake. Fine whatever I'll just drink it no biggie, no need to stare at us like we're the ones who are wrong. Up next was the food. My noodles came out without the glorious layer of shrimp roe. I had asked where my shrimp roe was, again I was given the whole ""you're wrong I'm right"" treatment. Now mind you, all the dry mixed noodles on the menu says ""shrimp roe dry mixed...."" so again somehow it's my mistake. Whatever, at this point I just wanted to eat and leave.I took a bite of the beef brisket and boy, not the usual quality. It's so bad, so dry/chewy. The tendon obviously wasn't cooked long enough either,like chewing thick pieces of gum. Then the veggies got here, the saddest plate of water spinach ever seen this side of Kowloon. Half of it was brown/overcooked. The wontons were overcooked, wonton skins were like mush.I never came in expecting world class service, but was instead sassed by a lady who obviously couldn't get it right and with food badly made. This place is a former shadow of itself, living only on the thin strands of whatever name it has made for itself in the past. Never again, I'll gladly go to the thousands upon thousands other of noodle shops in HK."
Lau Sum Kee Noodle,5,"This hidden gem in Sham Sui Po is known for its hand made noodles. The owner started his noodle soup business in a shack on he street, and eventually moved  in a brick and mortar. They are known for the following food items: 1. Soup Dumplings 2. Won tons (shrimp and pork)3. Shrimp roe with noodles 4. Pork feet 5. Beef brisket If you are in the neighborhood, come check it out. There is zero ambiance but you get the true Hong Kong experience. The store has been around for over 50 years."
Lau Sum Kee Noodle,4,"Like their Wonton noodles very much! The soup is the soul and they are just fantastic. Noodles are made by eggs and the taste is so good. Yet the restaurant is too small, you may need to sit with other customers, i think it is a normal phenomenon in Hong Kong."
Lau Sum Kee Noodle,4,"Shrimp roe noodle and soup, wonton, side of veggie with oyster sauce and nice server ladies, what more can you ask for. First time having shrimp roe noodles and it's quite good! It gets a little dry that's why they paired it with a soup for sipping or dunking, whichever you prefer. The soup may look like the wonton soup BUT!! it's not, it's a little saltier and bolder. Wonton- so good. Order this. Now. Veggies with oyster sauce- a classic (you can pick any types of veggie they offer but if you go later in the night they WILL run out, we were left with 1 option haha)"
Lau Sum Kee Noodle,5,"HK Island dwellers are missing out. Shum Shui Po (""SSP"") has so many good local eats, if you picked any shop on Fuk Wing Street and plopped it onto a random spot in Central, Wanchai or Causeway Bay, I guarantee that people would start raving about the 'local gem that has stood the test of time in a rapidly changing landscape'. Alas the rent on HK island doesn't allow small local eateries to survive on selling quality food at reasonable prices, and that's why us island dwellers should visit the dark side once in a while. Lau Sum Kee Noodles has been around and popular for years, the Fuk Wing Street location is actually their 2nd store in SSP to cater to the increasing traffic. They are known for making everything fresh and by-hand, bamboo noodles are their main sell. It means the noodles are made by having the cook 'ride' one end of a bamboo shoot up and down, where the other end of the bamboo is fixed to the table where the noodles are, and the cook's movements compresses and kneads the noodle dough so that it gets some 'bounce' in the bite. Think a see-saw, where the cook sits on one end and the noodles sit under the seat at the other end.Obviously such labor-intensive methods of making noodles is being automated and becoming obsolete, so any store that does this is kinda of the treasure of the dining scene. A famous one is Wing Wah Noodles in Wanchai, both that shop and Lau Sum Kee are good, but Lau Sum Kee charges a fraction of the price. A pork knuckle noodle with shrimp roe is only HKD 39, while this very same thing would cost HKD 60 in Wing Wah. AAND Lau Sum Kee puts massive doses of that magic powder I call shrimp roe on, just look at the dark gold sheen in my picture. I love that salty sea-fresh powder.Food is fresh here and wonton is also freshly made everyday. Another surprisingly good item is the cubed pickled turnip they have in jars on each table. It tastes similar to the Japanese ones, and is crunchy, sweet-sourish and refreshing. I have nothing bad to say about the food or the price. The location cannot be helped so you will have to come experience, a small tip is that when I come at night it is a bit less packed than during lunchtime."
Café Sausalito,5,"I'll admit: The ""Find Us On Yelp"" sign was the initial hook for coming here. Café Sausalito feels very random in the localsphere of Sham Shui Po, which is not a hotbed of foreign themed cafes, much less Yelp gung ho businesses. I eventually became a regular while keeping my expectations dialed low (#1) and learned to appreciate this place for what it was: a laid back cafe in the heart of SSP.At first, my visits were strictly to kill time, drink a little something, and get lost in internet space with their speedy WiFi, but I eventually graduated to spending copious amounts of time here while experimenting with their food options, while even holding a few business meetings here. Whenever I was in SSP, this eventually became my home away from home. It was like being in (a narrow room in) the US, but without all the commercialism.The interior is pretty tight; many folks who are working / studying (in addition to dining and sipping) are usually by themselves. It doesn't get too crowded in here even during peak hours, which is why I enjoyed coming here so often.The service is surprisingly great. The owner, Michael is extremely hospitable and the rest of the staff is very welcoming, amiable, and efficient. For expats who are coming here for a little breakfast nostalgia (especially their ever popular ""all-day breakfast"" for $88HKD), keep your expectations tapered in knowing the food will naturally be served in HK portions and tastes. Don't forget to enjoy one of their lovely mochas either inside (#2) or in their limited outdoor seating.___________(#1) Because ... western food in Hong Kong. (#2) Because ... AC."
Café Sausalito,5,"Really nice, cool, cafe!  The owner, Michael, is way friendly, and it was nice to chat with him.  Friendly atmosphere.  Good tea and coffee. Me and a group of friends hung out here for about 90 minutes."
Café Sausalito,5,"A little out of the way but well worth finding this gem.  As others have said, it's really the only place open early with a western breakfast menu. I had the smoked salmon croissant and my wife the meatballs - both were EXCELLENT. Freshly cooked but nice and quick food in a great little cafe environment. I wish we had a place like this near our home. The chef obviously cares about his food, paying attention to both taste and presentation -- and the prices are very reasonable!"
Café Sausalito,5,"I was craving a breakfast with eggs in it, which in Hong Kong is harder to find than one might think. Yelp is generally less used than TripAdvisor over here, but in this case, Yelp came through. Cafe Sausalito is the sort of place that would be one of my go-to spots if it were in LA. It's cozy, hidden away in the garment district, with a comfortable vibe and a super friendly staff. There's free wi-fi, and most importantly, the food was excellent. I got the all-day breakfast, which included eggs (perfectly cooked and elevated by the presence of mushrooms), smoked salmon, sausage, toast and a side salad. I was on vacation, so I wasn't really looking to do work here, but I could easily see myself ordering food and hanging out here on a regular basis to write or work on my laptop if I were a local. The food menu isn't huge, but everything on it sounded appetizing (i.e. ""small but mighty""), particularly given the quality of my first dish--definitely above the level of most cafes. Cafe Sausalito is definitely a winner."
Café Sausalito,5,"This is my new favorite spot in HK. The staff was unbelievably kind, warm, and welcoming. The food and coffee was UNREAL!! If you're craving good (all day) brunch or need a spot to get some work done, this is the place. I'll be back again, and again."
Café Sausalito,4,"A Café that encompasses an Australian coffee shop with the reminiscence of Sausalito California. This unexpected venue can be a gem in this hustling and bustling neighborhood where the fashion world meets its fabric, buttons and lace. Love the atmosphere. Has a friendly barista....also a mom 'n' pop joint with some hipster flair:) ... Will return!"
Café Sausalito,5,"I am so glad I stumbled across this place. Set amongst the button and zip shops of Sham Shui Po is this gem of a cafe, that would be perfectly at home in any Australian city. Michael and the team serve up top notch espresso based drinks and a tasty menu including a hearty all day breakfast with scrambled egg, salmon, bratwurst, delicious mushrooms and tomatoes. Get in before 11:30am and you get an espresso with it for free. Yes. Before 11:30am.Cafe Sausalito is the ONLY cafe I have found in the Sham Shui Po area to be open before 11am - these guys are kicking out the caffeine from 9am Tuesday to Saturday, and from 10am Sunday and Monday. Prior to finding this place I had to resort to McCoffee, which, as we all know, is not really coffee is it.A pleasant place to sit with the laptop and work away (free wi-fi is available), and great for families and small groups, the cafe is comfortable and attractive and with enough quirk in its decor to satisfy my inner hipster."
Café Sausalito,4,"Went to check it out at 830 on a Friday morning, but it wasn't open. I'm not sure what their hours are, but the ones posted on Yelp (open at 8 everyday) are not accurate. Gave it 4 stars to not make it look good or bad!"
House of Canton Restaurant,5,"ordered shrimp siu mai, seafood soup dumpling, spinach scallop dumpling, egg custard bun. about usd 30 bucks.giving three stars to the seafood soup dumpling, delicious quality chicken soup, seafood filled dumpling, (竹笙灌湯餃)two stars to the egg custard bun. excellent egg custard filling, slowly throw out the bun, touch of cooked salted duck egg yolk, sweet as a good dessert for the meal. (流沙奶黃飽)shrimp siu mai is fresh n average. (鮮蝦燒賣)spinach dumpling fiiled with spinach + salted fried garlic, n steamed minced garlic + tiny piece scallop, favourable :p (帶子菠菜餃)**comfortable seating, not noisy even when it's full house.**above average good quality of tea."
House of Canton Restaurant,4,"Good Cantonese style restaurant! I really enjoyed the 6 course dinner, absolutely scrumptious! Located inside the Festival Walk Mall in Kowloon Tong, this place attracts a lot of tourists and gets busy but it's worth the wait. I haven't tried the dim sum here but it must be very good based on my dinner experience so far."
House of Canton Restaurant,4,Authentic dim sum restaurant in festival walk. Expect long wait during lunch time but it's worth the wait. Highlight was the baby roast pork cubes. It's juicy and the skin was very crisp. Excellent !
House of Canton Restaurant,3,"Very typical of a restaurant in hong Kong. This is also a good place to  do wedding apparently... I saw a sign saying congratulation for joey and Alex. Anyway, decent food, not too expensive but if you are looking for cheap and affordable , you are in the wrong place"
Sun Hang Yuen,5,"I enjoyed this place. Very small, but standard size for a restaurant in HK. My husband and I got here early (6am) so we were able to come in and sit right away. My husband ordered the beef and egg sandwich on toast, I got the French toast. The French toast was amazing, so amazing I'm going back to get more before our flight leaves in a few hours!"
Sun Hang Yuen,3,"It's your typical HK style cafe. They don't have much sitting room in there but the tables should move quick because people just eat and go. No time for talking.They do have an English menu here so you can ask for that. Be prepared for under-the-breath griping by the staff if you are Asian but can't read Chinese LOL. It happened to us but we were too tired after a long flight to really care.They have all the basics you would expect at a super fast-casual HK style cafe. Sandwiches, soups, congee, and all other manner of food and snacks.We got two sandwiches and a HK milk tea to bring back to our hotel after arriving at 11PM. It was great to have something that was quick and filling so that we could quickly go to bed after.Pay in cash because I don't think they take credit."
Sun Hang Yuen,4,"A great place to stop for lunch, or any meal really, and enjoy local food in a casual setting!  To my surprise, they produced an English menu for me.  The beef and egg sandwich was good, and I can see why others describe it as comfort food.  I also really liked the HK-style iced tea.  I wish I could've tried the French toast too, but the sandwich was filling!"
Sun Hang Yuen,3,"Sun Hang Yeun is one of the more popular dining choices in the heart of Sham Shui Po.  Which says a lot because this area is known for many great local restaurants.  This is your typical 'Cha Chang Teng', aka Hong Kong style cafe.  What you wont find here is comfortable seating.  Its a very small place so you will be squeezed into a small table with strangers surrounding you.  You will also most likely have to wait to get seated.  I dont think I've ever seen this place without a line during regular dining hours.  Do note that they are supposedly open 24 hours.  They have all your typical HK cafe food, such as soup noodle, fish ball, beef, veggies, etc.  What they are most famous for however, is their pork/egg sandwiches, which you have the option of 'toast'ing the bread.  The sandwich is pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  But with that said, most of their food is quite tasty and cheap.  I would eat here if I was in the area, but I wouldnt go out of my way to come here specifically."
Sun Hang Yuen,4,"新香園(堅記) - (Sun Heung Yuen / Keen Gei) is another old time staple in the Sham Shui Po district.Sometimes you just want some snacks in the 'hood. Because there are so many tasty blue collar delights to be had in this part of town.蛋牛治烘底 - essentially scrambled eggs with canned corned beef sandwiched between two slices of toasted white bread, no doubt buttered for that extra bit of ""health"". It is done at such a nice level it is not funny (try finding a half decent rendition of this in San Francisco Bay Area....). This is their signature offering and 8 customers if not 9 out of 10, order this. Eggs over my moon hammy? GTFO here... Not exactly sexy looking food, but is comforting for the locals, and anyone with FOBenese tendencies.菠蘿冰 (pineapple ice) - there is nothing fancy about this drink. Pineapple chunks, liquid sugar, ice. Maybe a bit less glamorous than a glass of lychee ice drink at the hawker centers in Singapore, but it also hits the spot during December.Who needs Denny's or 7-Eleven in HK?This cafe is open 24 hours! Going to places like this, then visiting some random Hong Kong cafe in the San Gabriel Valley in Southern California makes me weep.Now don't get too full here. Snack, then move on to the next eating destination :-)"
Sun Hang Yuen,5,"A 24hr Hong Kong CCT 茶餐廳 in the heart of Sham Shui Po, come here for the famous corn beef and egg sandwich, congee are silky smooth with fresh toppings and their deadly French toast with butter and honey is also a must try. 100% Hong Kong comfort."
Sun Hang Yuen,4,"Great stop for the bleary-eyed novelty seeker, if you're in the area. That beef and egg sandwich really hit the spot.Yelp places this a block north of the actual location.Some basic directions. One, ask for the English language menu from the cashier and take any open seat. Two, try to shake the feeling that you're imposing your presence on a group of strangers. Three, take in as much of the atmosphere as you can before bringing your ticket to the register to pay."
Sun Hang Yuen,5,"Sham Shui Po's Kweilin Street is full of local authentic eateries.  Sun Hang Yuen cha chaan teng (新香園茶餐廳) is one of them.  I found out this place has been in business for quite awhile and it used be a dai pai dong.  To my surprise, this joint is open 24/7.  I specifically came to this cha chaan teng (Hong Kong style cafe) for their signature dish  ~ Scrambled Egg and Beef Sandwich (蛋牛治).  You can order it either on toasted bread (extra $1) or not toasted.  The place was full when I arrived so I decided just to order take out.  Withhin 2 minutes, the waitress handed over to me the pipping hot sandwich in a small plastic bag. This isn't the usual corned beef and scrambled egg sandwich you find in other cha chaan teng in Hong Kong.  This place actually uses fresh cut up beef, marinated just right and fried to perfection with the scrambled eggs.  A cheap delicious breakfast to go for only $17 HKD.  What more could I ask for?"
Sun Hang Yuen,5,Best egg & corn beef sandwich (蛋牛治) in the Po.  It opens 24 hours too!  Its always my biggest dilemma  to try to choose between 堅記 and 維記。
Jasmine,4,"Came here on a Tuesday night with my mom and some of her friends. I wouldn't say the place is packed, but pretty busy. We ordered a set dinner for four which is around $1500. It comes with a soup with edible bird nest, steam fish, veggie, fried rice, noodle with abalone, roast duck and dessert. the food was actually enough to feed 5 people, we ended up having leftovers and have to take it togo.Their service was okay, just okay. They were serving us dessert when we just had our soup... Not sure how can they make that mistake. soon after they realized they made a mistake and took it back to the kitchen. The food overall was super salty and oily. Don't get me wrong, the food are flavourful, but if they can use less sodium and oil, that will make things 10 times better. If I'm back next time, for sure needa ask the kitchen to use less sodium and oil!"
Jasmine,4,"I am a regular at this Chinese place. I have tried both the lunch dim sum menu and dinner menu. The quality if their dim sum is definitely about average, price is also very reasonable. Around 15 to 20 USD per person. Lunch can get hectic though, not easy to get attention from servers but you don't always expect good service in this city.P.S. You can download their app to wait in line for a table so it saves you time"
Jasmine,2,"2 stars mainly for being very disappointed with their inattentive service.We were here to celebrate my grandma's birthday. We arrived at 6pm on a Sunday night and we were only being properly served when:  1) we placed our order and 2) when we asked for the bill! Other then that it took us asking at least three staffs for extra bowls/ spoon and a few bowl of rices to go with the dishes. Nobody care when the table was packed with finished dishes/ bowls/ chopsticks when we were having desserts, and nobody care refilling our teapots. We were quite disappointed at the end that we had to voice out our concerns to the manager."
Jasmine,1,"I am having dinner here right now and the service sucks!. The place is 70% full but when i called the waiter that was standing at the wearing glasses, he acknowledged and just walked off."
Jasmine,3,My husband came here with a group of about 20 people. He said they filled two tables in the back of the restaurant. The service was very good and they kept bringing more and more food as fast as they could turn the lazy-suzan and eat. He said that they had a lot of different dim sum served and most of it was pretty good -- but not the best that you can get in Hong Kong.
Bau Heung Lau,3,"Went in twice in the past month to BHL. Thought I was most impressed by their French toast as a set of afternoon tea. It was fresh and fluffy and bite of joy and happiness. A choice of upgraded drinks come with the tea set and my choice was red bean ice. Also was no disappointment. The tea set was very affordable, considering that makes it competitive in where it's located.The second time I came back to try their ""usual"" set meal. Again it was very affordable. Probably was expecting things would come out superb after the last visit. However, the satay beef noodles was luke warm only. And their bread was not toasted. It was fairly disappointing. And in fact quite off putting."
Shia Wong Hip,5,"Not gonna lie, I was pretty apprehensive about coming here to eat snake. Just doesn't sound appetizing. I ain't exactly Andrew Zimmern. But I figured if I don't do it now, then I'll never do it. I'm really glad I did though. It really isn't as bad as I thought it was. It ain't exactly like they're serving you a bunch of dead snakes on a plate. It's just a bowl of soup with snake meat, that essentially tastes and looks like chicken. No lie. As others have mentioned, there is a high turnover rate here. Meaning that if you get here and it's packed, don't fret, you'll get a seat soon enough. The small snake (literal translation when you order in Cantonese) is $45 HKD. To me, the small is more than enough. On the table, they have these crunchy stuff you can add with your snake soup and it makes a world of difference. If eating snake meat makes you feel whatever, then adding the crunchy stuff helps. Aside from snake, they have other stuff you can order like the sticky rice, which is not bad, but for a small bowl, it'll set you back $17, which in my opinion is not worth it.Definitely something to try when in HK."
Shia Wong Hip,5,"Had to try the snake soup when I was in town and I was not disappointed. I would come back here everyday if I lived in HK. Most people say that snake tastes like chicken--and it does to an extent, but the flavor is much more than that! The snakes they use for the soup are housed in the shop (talk about farm to table lol), so the meat has a very fresh taste that you don't get with mass-produced, hormone-injected chickens these days. Also, the broth is very thick and fills you up. The soup is served with lemon leaves and fried dough ""chips"" which serve a a nice crunchy compliment to the stew. A large bowl is only around 74 HKD (10 HKD is $1.29 USD, so you do the math -- it's cheap!), so why would you not eat this everyday? Well maybe not everyday, but try it once and decide for yourself ;)"
Shia Wong Hip,5,Yummy. High turnover. U can tell that their snake skin soup is good because of how constantly busy they are. Definitely worth your time!
Shia Wong Hip,4,"Wow I felt like I got dropped on the set of the movie ""Big Trouble In Little China!""  Shia Wong Hip (SWH) is old school.  The stereotype of an esoteric Chinese curio shop!This brick and mortar business has had a mention on CNN and TripAdvisor.  Workers are used to the curious tourists and generally friendly.  It is smack in the middle of Sham Shui Po.  If you don't pay attention, you'll easily walk past it since it's somewhat hidden behind the sidewalk vendors on Apliu Street.The shop is old and looks it.  The space is tight and cluttered, yet SWH still manages to set up 3 to 4 tables to serve customers with.  It's not uncommon to have to share tables with other customers here.  The kitchen is tucked away in the back.  As you walk in, you will see cages with snakes inside.  There are two wooden cabinets that I could see and both are like ancient artifacts with tons of drawers.  Each slot has two Chinese words ""毒蛇"" in red labelled on it.  You guessed it!  Venomous snakes!  Our table was only inches away from these live venomous snakes in these drawers with really flimsy looking locks.  Let's just say we kept one eye on our food and one eye on those drawers.  SWH's menu is obviously serpentine-centric: soup, tempura, stir fry, wine.  But wait!  They even serve baby mice wine!  I have no idea how that worked but *gag*.  Really glad that I ate before seeing this special menu item.According to the locals, snake soup is supposed to have medicinal and nutritional value.  Best time to consume is in winter.  I was told that in order to bring out the snake flavor, add a pinch of lemongrass and white pepper in your bowl.  My soup was not as brothy as I had imagined but full of savory substances.  The snake meat had been deboned and came out very tender. Tasted like chicken!?  We ordered the sticky rice as well.  It was different but in a good way.  Definitely not something I can eat often.  It was rich and filling.  All in all, the whole experience was a bit too exotic for me but I'm glad everyone else enjoyed it.  We all had a great time."
Shia Wong Hip,5,"** My first yelp Hong Kong reivew **For me a trip to Hong Kong is not complete unless I have some snake soup.  This snake specialty restaurant is located in the heart of Apliu Street electronics flea market in busy Shum Shui Po district and is tucked away behind the vendor stalls.  It was recommended to me by a HK foodie friend of mine.  I was told this place has been open for business for over 35 years.  Their walls are lined with newspaper clippings and photos of famous people that have eaten there.  There are some snake skin handbags and wallets for sale on the shelf.  Behind their counter, there are some old wooden drawers that are probably full of snakes inside. There are also glass jars of preserved snake wine and other artifacts that give this restaurant a very distinct character.  We got there around 2 pm and sat at a round table with two other couples.  There are only a handful of tables in this restaurant.  We ordered two small bowls of snake soup and some stir fried sticky rice.  The soup was piping hot and was at our table within minutes.  The flavour was very good and it went very well with the sticky rice.  The combination of snake meat, shredded pork, wood fungus works well together in this thick broth.  It was very savory and delicious, just add a little bit of white pepper and I was in heaven.  I definitely will be back.  Yes, it was that good!!"
Shia Wong Hip,5,Ordered a large bowl of soup and a sticky rice. Soup was rich with strips of snake meat. The meat had the texture of fish but the flavour of chicken. Sticky rice was good. Not too sticky with a lot of ingredients. So midway through my meal I ask if I can see one of the snakes. The waiter obliged it and put it on my table! He then asked if I wanted to wear it on my head. I said yes and for 10 seconds I had a live snake hat. I would come here again definitely for the food. Hell I might come back before I leave town.
Shia Wong Hip,4,"A different and weird experience but nonetheless excellent food. We had the snake soup, turtle soup, snake fry and took home some snake wine. Must try for food aficionados."
Pepper Lunch,5,"This has to be the greatest fast food chain. The food taste and quality is there, the service is decent, and you actually get your food quickly.  You basically order some type of beef (although I think they also have a chicken dish or two) and they will serve it to you raw on a sizzling platter. It's hot enough where it basically cooks right in front of you. FOODThe menu isn't the clearest. In fact, I often find myself scrambling to search for what to order. There aren't tons of things on the menu but there is enough variety to add some confusion. Basically, there's a regular menu and then they have these special items like Australian or American beef on side menus. I've tried the regular beef (thin slices), steak , Australian beef (thin slices). Everything I've tried has been good. They also have add on's like egg. SEATINGIt usually isn't easy to find available seating. This shop is part of a food court in the mall."
Pepper Lunch,3,"It's great fast food in food court. It's sizzling hot and smell and taste good. When you want something quick, this is a nice choice."
City University of Hong Kong AC3 Bistro,3,"The canteen is open to the public and not just university staff and students. It is located conveniently off the Kowloon Tong MTR station and accessible through the shopping mall Festival Walk. You can place orders for food at the front desk or through a touchscreen monitor that accepts Octopus cards. For those who don't read Chinese, the menu can display in English as well. After placing your order, be sure to look on your receipt(s) for the letter/number combo that directs you to which counter you need to pick up your food items. I've tried the fish shumai, baked cheese tart, eggplant with minced pork, baked grouper filet over rice, + some more. The food is budget friendly and portion is pretty big. I would consider dining here if nearby and don't want to spend too much or eating with university friends. It is well air conditioned in the summer and there's also water you can help yourself to near the silverware area."
City University of Hong Kong AC3 Bistro,3,"Very solid 3.8 stars, probably a 4 IF they ever accepted credit cards outside of their only one brand, which I can't remember---think it was the university one.  What a travesty, especially for foreigners lol.But it's surprisingly good food, and value too.  Wouldn't say it only caters to students being on campus, as several business ppl in suits but it's massive; easy 100+ seater, in 2 different rooms.  Nice that there was a big terrace and decent view.Easy to order menu to check off, the flat noodles, and the regular Ha Cherng (shrimp rolls, not the dumplings), here they toast sesame seeds on top.  Soya sauce not too sweet either.Beef sprout flat noodles also good too, as well as the roasted pork and goose, surprisingly.  Sweet and sour pork, BBQ bun were OK.White table linens, bonus."
愛文生,5,Service was surprisingly nice and quick!The food was excellent as it brought back alot of nostalgia as a kid. Local HK Dai Pai Dong like these don't exist as much anymore. Can't go wrong with any dish you order here as it packs alot of heat literally from that fire hot wok!
愛文生,5,"One of the best local meals that I have had in Hong Kong in quite some time.  It's nice to know that you can still find places like this, where local chefs can still churn out traditional dishes with banging flavor without all the extra added fanfare and gimmicks.  Canto drinking food at its best, is how I would personally describe it.  It's great because not everything is fried, but still got that bold flavor that can stand up to whatever you're drinking.  And in terms of drinks, they sell beer here, but usually they don't make a fuss if you bring in something stronger on your own.The highlight for me would definitely be the pork knuckle and the razor clams.  Bring them to me cold and they would still taste better than most other places.  The pork knuckle has this deep black pepper sauces, and the collagen made the whole dish super tender.  The razor clams was seriously legit.  Super fresh so I could taste that natural sweetness and paired perfectly with the black bean sauce.In addition to the food, the atmosphere here was killer.  Or maybe that was only our table...  Already dying to go back..."
愛文生,5,"Wanted to get some REAL food (Dai pai Dong) here in HK, so this place spoke to me while looking on yelp.Damn, all the dishes were legit. Well except the fried tofu, who likes tofu anyways except my lil ones? So that doesn't count!The shrimp's were so off the charts, we ordered a 2nd round, along with the Ong Choy!! The crab was a bit spicy for our taste, so maybe order it scallion/ginger style. 10 plates of food along with a soup, 1590 HKD. Fuxk it, you can't EAT YOUR MONEY! Spend it on food for your soul!This place is janky as hell, but WhoTF cares, you don't live here!BOMBASS GOOD!"
愛文生,4,"So many 大牌檔 around that area; however, this old time place is still the most crowded and famous restaurant. My recent HK business trips, we definitely will stop by here for 小炒王 and 燒鴿子"
愛文生,4,This place is a typical hongkong style Dai Pai Dong nothing fancy but every single dishes were so awesome and the portions are Big. Its a bit to walk from MTR station so take the cab to get here.
Billy Boozer,4,"This is as close to a smelly old English style pub you are going to find in Hong Kong, and that is not necessarily a bad thing! It's situated in Lok Fu although I think it's probably closer to the Kowloon Tong MTR station. Billy Boozer's gets its charm from the fact that it is very close to what was a British Army barracks (Pre handover). It's easy to imagine hoards of British army personnel getting drunk on their night off, I think a few of them might have stuffed their dirty socks down the back of some of the seats giving this place a unique aroma!That being said this place has got real character and it is mainly visited now by students from a local college. There is dart boards and board games should that interest you. They do offer food although I did not order any, however from what I saw it looked decent. It's a English pub in a very strange location in the depths of Kowloon so if you are in the area and looking for an old style slice of nostalgia, Billy Boozers will deliver and probably leave you with a very big hangover!"
Billy Boozer,4,"On entering this location you will find that this bar seems to be distinctly different to anything else around here- the wooden beams, the plaques on the wall seem to tell of a different time. And you would be right. The Billy Boozer's main clientele at one point in time had been British army servicemen stationed nearby at Kowloon Tong barracks (just across the road) and you can tell from the distinct design of the bar that this place would have been well suited to receive such guests.Times have changed and the soldiers have left- the replacement clients now are mainly university students from the nearby universities ( BU and CUHK) which means this place is now even more packed than it used to be. You will find that they haven't really done much to spruce up the place and it does give you a bit of a dingy feeling. However, given the fair prices for beer towers (can't really remember how much) and the proximity to universities nearby you will always have students flooding in.As ""European"" as the bar is you will find dice games are played all round- local and exchange students alike and there is a section devoted to two darts machines out the back which tells you this place is more for fun and games than a quiet chat. I guess if you were looking for a quiet chat you wouldn't be coming here anyways. I hear that food is served here but have never tried it and neither would I recommend any one to. As a dark, dingy and small place to get completely plastered with your mates- you can't beat it!"
Dan Ryan’s Chicago Grill,5,"Heaven on earth for Anericans who aren't big fans of Chinese Chinese food. Awesome steaks, sides, rolls, lasagna. You name it and it's good at DR in Kowloon."
Dan Ryan’s Chicago Grill,1,"47 minutes waiting on 2 poached eggs and a sausage, the kitchen could not seem to make it successfully. Plenty of other people who ordered after me got their food before me. Crazy. Will definitely not return to the Festival Walk branch or any others. Avoid."
Dan Ryan’s Chicago Grill,2,"Right after we landed, and this was our first visit to hong kong, my buddy who was there already and has been 10 times took us here for drink and late night dinner. He said when he worked in china he used to love coming here for americanized food. I was thinking i just got here, I dont want americanized food, but thats my issue not the restaurants. The restaurants issue is mediocre service, average food at a high ticket for what you get. We got two beers and two appetizers and the bill was $80 US. If you are visiting from america, id skip this place unless you are completely lacking in adventure."
Dan Ryan’s Chicago Grill,2,"Food is overpriced for what it is, and service (at least today, on a Sunday, when I came for lunch) is absolutely nonexistent. In all honesty their food quality has been going down for years, I decided to give it another try today and found that it has not improved in the slightest. The pasta I had was bland and mostly flavorless, and only had a huge portion size going for it. Coke was watered down."
Dan Ryan’s Chicago Grill,2,"I was dragged here due to some school group dinners, but dang, the food is just bad here. After living in the states for my whole life, I have some expectations for my American foods. The onion ring is too soft, and the burgers are just no. The only saving grace is the food portion. The quality? Nah."
Queen’s Cafe,4,"A nice step into the past. Queens cafe in Kowloon Tong may not be the original shop from 1952, but it's a great glimpse into how ""soy sauce western"" found it's feet into our HK culinary history.Of course, the baked pork chop rice is an absolute classic, a must try, and you will not be shorted by the pork and rice either. Only qualm was that it wasn't served in an oven plate so you didn't get the ""bubbling tomato sauce effect"" that one usually associates with this dish.The borsch too, is Hong Kong style, but creamier than most chaan teng varieties. Andrews mom actually ordered the onion soup and oh my god it was so good. So homely, and with a cheesy slice of bread to soak too. The historian in me actually loves this place so I may be biased about the food. But where else in the world will you get a steak with black pepper sauce served with some fried rice? Actually Andrews mom said it best: ""Now, they call stuff like this 'fusion' but this is just how we ate in Hong Kong."""
Queen’s Cafe,3,Not bad. Got the beef shashlik lunch special. Comes with soup and coffee or tea. Swapped out my coffee for iced coffee. Borsch soup was good. Shashlik (kabob) was good. Didn't expect too much but everything was basically decent.
Queen’s Cafe,1,"The food is not up to par but the worst is their service especially that manager. i had never done this before, when i was leaving i walked up to that manager and told him their service sucks and left."
Pacific Coffee,4,"This is no longer Pacific Coffee but Starbucks instead... Living in this area is actually pretty awesome.. Close to festival walk  MTR, Train and many amazing foods...There is a Pacific Coffee right when you enter FW,  so if u r a huge fan of Pacific coffee instead, it's literally around the corner..I enjoy the seating and everything else here...opens early and isn't super noisy. I like HK Starbucks way better than CAD, just a personal preference. All in all, grab a quick coffee and move on with my day..."
Heritage Tea House,5,"Heritage Tea House is my rainy day happy place. As a cozy, tucked away haven Heritage Tea House offers an ambiance that calls for a large comfy chair and a good book you just can't put down - but instead you will find yourself seated at a wooden table gazing at Asian art surrounding you. There's something tranquil about this place as each table has its own tea kettle heater, the staff are always ready to take your order, and once the food comes out you will think you have found your way to heaven. I typically go for lunch and get the lunch set - a steal at HK$40 - including tea and dumplings with noodles. I often get the butterfly cookies (2 for HK$10) just to top off this delightful experience. Something about this magical place on a rainy day makes for the perfect relaxation during lunch to get me recharged to make it through the rest of the day. Come early or late though as there is limited seating to be had!"
Central Restaurant,3,I came here for a family dinner. They have a solid Cantonese menu with a lot of old school dishes. Their food is well made but I can't say they use the best ingredients. Overall it's good value for money and you can experience what a traditional Cantonese restaurant is like.
Yun Kee Kitchen,5,"I come here for the roast pork because it is one of the best I have tasted in HK.  However, it was quite disappointing last time I was here as they mentioned they were out of the roast pork..Tip: come early (before 7pm) because it gets packed here!"
Yun Kee Kitchen,4,"Very affordable and lots of variety. Expect to be seated with other patrons, family style. One time, I was at a table by myself, and a pretty young Chinese girl came to my table and sat across from me. It was a little awkward at first, but we had a nice time chatting once the ice was broken.You will be handed an English menu with lots of pics that show what the dishes are. A cup of lukewarm tea is the standard beverage, and anything else will have to be ordered. One odd thing I noticed is that no napkins are on the table, and you have to ask for one. No big deal.I've been adventurous and tried a number of different things. Their specialty is tripe on top of noodle soup or over rice, but I haven't gone there yet. I have had the tendon, fatty brisket, salted duck egg, and pork belly. All have been delish!If you want to stay on the tame side, crispy roast pork, roast duck, and char siu style pork are very good choices. I've never left here paying more than ten bucks or so. This is my ""go-to"" joint when I'm in Hong Kong."
Yun Kee Kitchen,4,"My friends have been raving this place non-stop so we came when we finally had a chance!  A very popular place indeed (not to mention it's been around forever)!  We missed out on the signature roast pork belly (燒肉)!!!  It is a good place for a larger crowd but since there were only 3 of us, we sticked to the basics.  Can't wait to return to try more of their dishes!"
Ana Gura,4,This Japanese restaurant is located inside a mall in Kowloon. Food was pretty good! I was pretty full from lunch so I ordered a couple of small things which included a soup that they served in a teapot. Not sure if its something they actually do in japan but the seafood soup was delicious and one can pick out all the food after the broth is consumed. It was bigger than it looked! Id come back again if it was convenient
Ana Gura,4,Fresh high quality sushi in Central. Good for business lunch. If you love fatty sashimi definetely need to try it out. Lunch sets have good portions. Tempura also very well done - especially if you like thin battered tempura. Has some very special tempura items i.e uni. It is a must try!
Kakurega Ramen Factory,4,"Its a bit of adventure to find this place, but that's part of the fun. Once you find it (At the back of apple mall within Dragon Centre), you may need to queue. There's no reservation for this place. Their simple dipping ramen menu consists of three types. They only make about 100 bowls per serving hour so you may be out of luck if you arrive late.The décor is simple. Some wooden panels and the chairs are coke cartons zipped tied together giving it a very ""shum shui po"" feel. In all honesty, there are more dipping ramen places in Hong Kong to try. But if you happen to be in the area... or you happen to be in Shum Shui Po, this is a great place to nom."
Kakurega Ramen Factory,4,"As others have mentioned, this spot was pretty difficult to locate. We spent quite some time walking through the labyrinth of small stores/vendors before finding the shop in the very back corner of the 7th floor. Other than that, food and service were great. I love tsukemen and I'm so glad I got to try this place on our last day in HK. I would say this tops my list as the second best tsukemen style ramen (aka dipping noodes) I've had thus far (Tsuijita in LA being the best imo). Also, ordering is pretty easy. They give you a piece of paper (like dim sum) and you select what you want and additional toppings, drinks, sides, etc. They have two versions- Chinese and English. Just make sure to ask because I think they hand you the Chinese version by default."
Kakurega Ramen Factory,5,"Hidden gem in Sham Shui Po! My favorite tsukemen in Hong Kong!Who knew you could find good Japanese food here? It's literally hidden in Dragon Center in the back corner down an alley way on the 7th floor. I've been here twice, and I loved it both times. How to tsukemen: For those who have never had tsukemen, this is a dip noodle. Basically, you take their homemade noodles and dip it into the broth for flavor and then you eat it. Simple right? It also keeps the noodles at a chewy consistency. When you're all done eating and dipping the noodles, they will pour stock into your broth to dilute it so you can drink it after. The broth itself is intense for noodle dipping, so you must dilute it to drink or else it's too much. How to order: You're given a piece of paper to order the food, and you select what type of tsukemen you would like. They only have three different flavor broths (white, black, red), so it's not a hard decision. White is original, black is garlic-y, and red is tomato-y. If you add more ingredients then they'll charge more. This place generally costs 100-150HKD, depending on what broth and add-ons you get. My favorite is the white because the black is too garlic-y but the red is a close second. I like to add another egg (your ramen comes with one already) because those things are halfway cooked, runny, and delicioussss. I also add menma, which is fermented bamboo shoots that go perfectly with ramen. Yummm.The ambience is alright. It's a small place so don't expect a lot. The interior is pretty cute despite the location as it reminds me of Japan. The chairs here are the worst since they're stacked crates with very little leg room. I sit off to the side to make up for that, but if you're tall, you've got some problems. The service is spot on! They're super nice and ask if you need help with ordering since tsukemen isn't really common. My waitress was lovely and came whenever I needed any help, which it was a lot because my friends kept asking for things. We all needed stock for our broth at different times, and she was still so patient with us. Loved her!"
Kakurega Ramen Factory,5,"There's not much to add after Joann's review - but I just gotta say this place is FANTASTIC! I love tsukemen and it's hard to find a place that does it well!It's hard to locate - we walked around Sham Shui Po after exiting the MTR, realized it's in the Dragon Center, and then we eventually stumbled around on the seventh floor until we got to the restaurant. It's located behind tiny Japanese stores.Apparently this place is owned by a famous Japanese chief that makes only 200 bowls of ramen per day - we came early (15 mins before opening time) and there wasn't anyone here yet....but it quickly filled up!"
Kakurega Ramen Factory,5,"Came here while visiting HK and I must say the ramen was one of the best I have ever had. Coming from NYC, I have quite a lot of quality choices but this spot has exceeded all my favorites back at home. My local HK friend guided and lead the way to this hidden gem as it was through some twists and turns inside the Dragon Centre mall in Sham Shui Po. If you told me to go there again, I seriously may have trouble finding it. We had a party of three and arrived at around 6:45 or so, we were lucky there was no wait but as we left, there was a queue outside. I had the tomato based broth. Coming from the states, I have never had this broth before, not sure if they offer it in the US. But I must say it was so good and delicious! Having to dip the ramen was different from the typical ramen sitting in the broth. The ramen was chewy and not soggy, just the way I like. I would definitely recommend this ramen spot to anyone visiting HK or lives there. It is not a fancy restaurant and quite small but definitely worth checking out. Definitely on my list again for my next holiday in HK."
Kakurega Ramen Factory,2,"Both my girlfriend and I got sick after dining at the kakurega ramen place, and that was the only thing we both ate that day. While we thought the ramen itself tasted a-ok, we didn't understand what the rave was about. Maybe it just wasn't to our taste. I found the soup more salty/greasy than tasty, i.e. dipping the ramen in more soup made it too salty/greasy, while dipping it in less left it tasting blend. I couldn't find the illusive sweet spot after eating the whole bowl.The Japanese owner (or someone that resembled such) attentively waited on our table... ""Table"" might be the wrong word. What we dined at could charitably be described as stacks of crates. The environment was unappetizing, but I guess some people might like this kind of back alley setup. The meal came with a hefty price tag given what it was -- both in money and in health -- I'm writing this review with a painful stomach. Not a place that we would recommend or visit again ourselves. 2 stars."
Tea Coffee Two,5,"My friends and I came to this cute and homey cafe on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and coffee, and we definitely were not disappointed. I had their hazelnut latte and it's one of the best ones I've had in Hong Kong. The hazelnut flavor was strong, but not over powering, and just sweet enough. I also love that they write different things in the foam of their coffee drinks!"
Tea Coffee Two,3,"Nice cafe in Prince Edward area and very close to MTR station. They have pastas, salads, coffee, and tea. I tried a salad and lychee tea which were both good. In the $40+ range and a good deal for what you get. It's a very relaxing environment and was able to chat for quite awhile on a Saturday afternoon, and they don't rush you.A good place to catch up with people and will return when nearby."
Tea Coffee Two,5,"I stopped by in the early evening for just a normal milk tea. It was $30 HKD for a tall iced glass, and delicious! The place has a great ambiance, with soft and relaxing music playing in the background - great for reading, studying, working, etc. The staff are friendly and speak enough English."
Yummy Cart Noodles,5,"My husband and I just moved to Hong Kong and while staying in a hotel prior to moving into our flat, we noticed we were spending around $40 US eating out for lunch and dinner around town.  Our new mission: to find great food cheap.We happened upon Yummy Cart Noodles while searching for something to eat prior to shopping in Wan Chai.Omg!  We walked out with a $14 US ($86 HK) bill for two meals!!!  I feel like we hit the food jackpot because this place delivers on good, tasty food.  When you walk in you will be seated at a five person table with short stools to sit on and a basket of chopsticks in the center.  You share tables in Hong Kong because space is a premium :).  The staff gave us laminated menus and with words in Cantonese and English.  Take a dry erase marker and start circling what you want.  You can choose a bowl or plate of noodles of various types.  The bowl comes with or without broth and whatever you choose to put in it.  I like mine with broth, ramen noodles, shrimp dumplings, enoki mushrooms, and fish balls. I have not tried the plate in the two times we have visited, but I will the next.  You also circle your drink and hand your menu to the staff.Within 10 minutes or less (last time it came out in 5 mins), you are eating!  It is so good and filling.  We purposely went to Wan Chai the other day from Discovery Bay just to have lunch here!  And it won't break your budget!"
Yummy Cart Noodles,5,This place is the BOMB!!! Ordering was quick & easy， food comes out quick. You can taste that everything was made IN- HOUSE， with care! I cannot stress how delicious the meaI was!!!10/10 will be back!
Kwan Kee Store,5,"This might be a little funny to some of you guys but I didn't realize the name of the store is actually printed/ written backwards at the store front. I was looking all over the neighborhood trying to find this traditional Hong Kong style rice cake place but had gotten lost due to my own clumsiness.Fast forwarding to the rice cakes-- it is absolutely delicious and super fresh! Some are wrapped in banana or lotus leaves, others are freshly steamed in bowls and pans. There are photos being displayed on the side of the wall where you can see the descriptions and exactly what it looks like.  I was instantly curious enough to try up to three different rice cakes. My favorite had to be the rice cake that's wrapped inside banana leaves where it's also stuffed with nutty sweet coconut. Now if you're a fan of coconuts you'll love it as much as I did. It was still warm before it was packed which makes it that much better.I highly recommend this place and please, be curious enough to try them all! You won't regret anything you get because it's just that delicious!"
Kwan Kee Store,4,I got some 砵仔糕 for myself and my family. They were semi sweet. Good amount of sweetness for my sweet tooth craving. It was not too watery where it have the pudding texture. Very bouncy.This was a very busy corner where lots of locals go and buy their sweets. It's in the corner a building and on a busy street. Have to squeeze your way into the front to get your food.
Kwan Kee Store,1,Don't bother with this place for rice pudding who claims to be Michelin Star. I had really high hopes since I was coming from the US and yelp reviews claim that this place was good. What a huge mistake it was. Pudding tasted very stale probably because they had nobody in line to purchase there items. Very disappointed and lady working there was very rude too!!!Stay Away!!!
Sharetea,5,"I love the texture of the pearls! It's the perfect blend of hard, soft and chewy all the same time (if that makes sense to you!). The milk tea is a bit sweeter than other chains, but still tastes wonderful."
Sharetea,4,"I love my smoothies. I guess that's why I'm so smooth? I had a Taro smoothie here and oh Lord the moment it hits your lips.....it's so good!  Do it up again!  Oh wait that's flashbacks to college. Anyways, you can't go wrong here. I prefer to lower the sugar to 80% because they say I'm sweet enough already. Expect a wait after ordering. I always prefer a wait after ordering food and drinks to begin with. It hopefully means they are crating something good and here, they don't disappoint."
Sharetea,4,"Drank share tea in hk, China, Singapore, Philippines and Thailand. It is always got to be Okinawa milk tea! Roasted brown sugar taste that goes so well with milk tea"
Sharetea,4,"Taiwanese Milk Tea was a huge disappointment when I was in Taiwan. Chalk it up to high expectations perhaps, but boba milk teas are just about the same if not worse in Taiwan than it is in Hawaii.When I found that there was a Sharetea, a Taiwanese based boba shop, was right down the road from my place, it was decided that I would give it another try. Hey, it's Hong Kong and I love Hong Kong's attitude towards food, even in out-of-country chains. They go HAM on everything. So here I was, ordering a standard boba Taiwanese milk tea. I popped the straw into the seal and said to myself, ""here goes"". I was so glad I gave it another try. Shame I couldn't try any other Shareteas in Taiwan. Although I've had many other popular brands in Taiwan, nothing really stood out until I tried Sharetea on Cheung Sha Wan. Even if my preference is Hong Kong style milk teas, this is now my go-to spot for boba."
Sharetea,4,"PRICE:  A+The prices for boba in Hong Kong are incredibly cheaper than they are in the US.  $2 USD here vs $4+ in the states.DRINK:  AThe drink I got was the oolong milk tea, and it was roasted to perfection.  Very good balance of sweetness and tea taste, and a much more well done job than their San Francisco branch counterpart.BOBA: BWasn't as good as I was hoping it to be - a bit hard rather than soft/chewy.  Sweetness of the boba was also a bit off, and overall could have been much improved.  Overall, I would definitely return here to satisfy my cravings if I ever need to when I return."
Sharetea,4,"3.5/5 for consistency On our way home, we stumbled upon this Sharetea kiosk.Conversation to myself:""Why should I get Sharetea here? We have them back home in the US!""""But what if this HK Sharetea is different??!""""Yes, must get one""I just ordered the simple Taiwanese milk tea--eh, typical, and yes, tasted just like the US =P"
McDonald’s,4,"Ok. I am not a McDonald's fan but this McDonald's is different as it provides Create Your Taste burger !! My very first time trying it and it's fun. Though by the time you check out, you will realise the price has gone way up than the original $45 as you would like to add this and that onto your burger. But I guess it worths.Too bad the french fries are still mcdonald's ordinary french fries. I was expecting fried potatoes or onion rings. But anyway... I guess I have created a very tasty burger XD"
McDonald’s,3,"I don't usually visit McDonald's often in the US, but I make an exception when visiting overseas to see how the menu differs elsewhere. McD's is very popular in HK. And this location at Festival Walk is no different.It is down the hall from the food court. There are two lines. One is the regular line if you are ordering their regular burger/sandwich menu. While there is a shorter line to the right which is for McCafe items. The menu here consists of coffee and tea drinks that are comparable to Starbucks.I got a earl grey tea latte (HK$26) from McCafe which was enjoyably dreamy and frothy. There isn't enough seating here. The McCafe seating area is rather small and I did not see any seating on the McDonald's side either. Thus I had to venture into the food court to find a seat.If you decide to visit this location on the weekends, expect long lines and likely a wait for a seat. If you can't stand waiting, get takeout and find a seat in the food court. Though again there may be limited seating there too, especially if you need a large table for a group."
Kung Fu Dim Sum,5,"I loved this place! Wonderful service and incredible food! They were very accommodating to our larger party of international travelers, and very attentive to service. This is a locals place for sure, but don't hesitate to enjoy this amazing restaurant."
Kung Fu Dim Sum,5,This place was a small local place that specialized in dim sum all day.   All the dishes that I ordered were great.   The price was extremely good and of great value.  The only issue was that it could get really crowded and you will have to share table with other patrons.
Man Fat Restaurant,5,"My taste buds have been blessed like never before. A hugely popular restaurant in Sham Shui Po, this local favorite has 3 locations on the same street that share the same kitchen. It's definitely beneficial to know the language and style of ordering before coming to one of the remaining restaurants in Hong Kong that will give you that old-school Hong Kong feel, where tables spill onto the street and extends down an alleyway. A friend of a friend brought us here on a Monday night after a long day of boating, so you can imagine how hungry we were! The moment we sat down (in a prime location: next to the where the butchers are slicing and dicing the freshly made roast pork, duck, etc.), our waiter, a older gentleman has tea and utensils ready and has a notepad out for our order.Now I can't tell you the actual name of each dish in Chinese, but please refer to my photos to reference the dish. (If need be, show your waiter the photo! You won't regret it.)Seasoned potatoes with steak: I believe this is the first thing on the menu, and with good reason! I don't know what kind of seasoning they used but the taste of these potatoes are out of this world. These are definitely not your run-of-the-mill sliced potatoes. I felt obligated to offer the last piece to my friends but breathed an internal sigh of relief when they declined and I was able to have it for myself. The steak was delicious as well, tender and just the right size to have with the potatoes!Seasoned crawfish with ginger and scallions: These are so fresh! You can walk right up the seafood market next door and ask for a pound of these crawfish to be cooked. There's a technique to eating these: rip off the head, then take the tail and pull lightly to separate the shell from the meat.Scallops with vermicelli: A giant scallop seasoned with cooked ginger and vermicelli. I practically inhaled this. The scallop and vermicelli both complemented each other; the subtle flavors of each mixed with the ginger.Roast Quail: Quail can be a bit difficult to eat, with many small bones, but it was worth it! The skin of the quail was flavorful and not too salty, and the meat tender.Battered Squid: I love seafood, particularly fried calamari, so if you're like me, you will love this dish! While similar to fried calamari, the batter for this squid is light and doesn't overwhelm the squid. The squid itself was perfectly chewy and not rubbery at all.Veggies with egg and preserved duck egg: Perfectly cooked veggies in a broth I would have loved some extra rice to pour into. The egg and preserved duck egg both add some extra kick to this dish.Fatty beef with broad noodles clay pot: I almost didn't think I could fit any more food into me, but I had to try it. The beef had just enough fat on it and was sliced thin enough to enjoy. The noodles and broth were delicious.100% would recommend to a friend, a stranger, an enemy! The total came out to about 188 HKD each, between the 4 of us. Well worth it."
Café Golden,4,"During my high school years, one of the A-levels that I studied was Geography. The most memorable thing in those piles of notes are the part where they talk about the Old Industrial Buildings Revitalization scheme in Hong Kong. With most of the projects nearly finished, I have been traveling back and forth to see all these new places. One of which is The Jockey Club Creative Arts Centre located in Shek Kip Mei. It was once an nine-storey factory and now has transformed into an art colony. The first thing that caught my eyes had to be the Café Golden which is on the first floor with a wooden plague hanging at the entrance. This place has a rather simple décor but I have heard so much about this place with its professional and knowledgeable staff and nicely brewed coffee.I am definitely not a coffee fanatic who needs my fix once a day. As a matter of fact, I rarely go to coffee shop (even if I do, I order those caffeine free drinks...) However, the quality of the coffee here is top-notched. I tried the Cappuccino and I was rather surprised to see the foam cap as smooth as soufflé, which is really difficult to make. I do not know about its secret but with that foam cap I will be coming back for sure! Even though this place is rather far, its talkative staff really makes me want to come here more often and be friends with them. They do care."
Nha Trang Thanh,4,"Tucked away in the far corner of this loud and dirty food court is a hidden gem. A Vietnamese food stall that doesn't suck. For some reason, Vietnamese food in Hong Kong is horrible... overpriced and far from its true authenticity. But this place is the complete opposite. It's very reasonably priced, everything is under $40. I always order the rice vermicelli with the egg rolls and pork chop, $32. Add $3 for iced Vietnamese drip coffee, a must have!"
Nha Trang Thanh,3,"Middle of the road 3 Yelp review.  Nothing to write home about. The food hall in this cooked food center was easy to find and felt very local.  Lots of seating and menu is also in English, so easy to order if you do not speak the language.  Staff seemed friendly enough. Our food was average.  Not bad, just average.  I have really nothing more to say about it.  Average is average.It was absolutely cheap and affordable, so it has that going for it."
Nha Trang Thanh,4,"Located at a cooked food market in Sham Shui Po, Nha Trang Thanh will surely give you a taste of Vietnamese authenticity.  Some history facts before introducing the food: since the 1970s, the former Urban Council and Regional Council built a number of these cooked food markets attached to wet markets around Hong Kong to deter unlicensed cooked food hawkers on the street. With the refurbishment and improvement of the management of public markets over the last decade, those markets have been a popular place for all walks of life nowadays because of the food of decent price and of quality. Do not let the local crowds scare you and take the seats when available. This place is like those traditional Dai Pei Dongs so you are in for a treat of a more local atmosphere.I strongly recommend the Pho and the Lemongrass Pork Chop. The former one has such a sweet beefy flavor to the broth unlike those you may find MSG in most other restaurants; while the latter one has a really strong flavor of lemongrass that makes you feel like you are enjoying this meal in Vietnam. One special thing about this place is that you can mix in condensed milk with your coffee according to your own desire. Therefore, it saves you to trouble to tell the waiters about your choice of coffee.The price range is around $30-50, which is such a bargain with such high quality food. So, next time if you are looking for a not-as-touristy Vietnamese place to go to, why not give it a try and share a beer with the locals?"
Hay Fever Floral & Gifts,5,Exceptionally great coffee found in the cafe at the back of the florist! Makes a trip to the flower market much more bearable. There is a selection of pastries and cakes on offer as well and some pretty cool Japanese style plants.
Hay Fever Floral & Gifts,4,"Coffee shop within a flower shop, I've enjoyed a nice cup of java here while looking at all the floral landscapes that this shop offers. the cafe is not as large as others but enough seats to enjoy your breakfast. Other then my latte, they have the best lemon poppy seed cup cakes."
Thai Chiu,5,"Thai Chiu is one of the best Thai places I have had since coming to Hong Kong - and that is saying something as there are so many good Thai places to choose from. My go to here is the Lunch red curry set - it comes with a choice of beef, chicken or pork as well as a choice of white rice or Thai soup. Not to mention, every meal comes with chicken broth based vegetable soup which is delicious! I also think the wait staff here are extremely personable, attentive, and they make a concerted effort to speak English with me as a non-native Cantonese speaker. I come here at least once a week, the lunch sets are about HK$48, and between the two areas there is always a place to sit!"
Thai Chiu,4,"If you happened to be in the neighborhood, itd be a good eat. Not sure if it's worth going out of your way to try it. It's still good but there are better chicken rice else where in SQ,MY or even HK."
Thai Chiu,4,The pork jowl had nicely fried edges and was exceedingly tender.  The fried chicken wings were pretty decent also.
Urban Coffee Roaster,5,"Awesome coffee shop in the middle of mongkok Hong Kong! Loves the vibes and the back area is super cool. A mix of vinyls, movie theater seating and all sorts of random stuff that somehow just fits into the chaos of Hong Kong. Will come back next time I'm in town"
Urban Coffee Roaster,4,"They have a pretty decent coffee collection and breakfast menu. Although I don't think they are the strongest on keeping their beans up to date (as two espressos I had on different days were extremely different and variable), they do an admirable job at learning about coffee and trying to put that in practice. There breakfasts are simple but fairly tasty for a coffee shop and I would recommend it if you are there, especially because hostel stayers get a 20% off.What I like is this place brings a modern feeling atmosphere with some hipster vibes. If you go to the back it's an electic assortment of random items that make you feel like you've gone through a hipster portal. There's also a kitchen in the back for the associated hostel stayers. Occasionally they have coffee couplings after hours so check out their website for more info."
Urban Coffee Roaster,5,"This place probably best for filtered coffee out of their large collection of bean. If you are here for the espresso based coffee, you might found it less good than the experience you get from their carefully brewed filtered coffee. I really enjoyed my cup for such fine selection and fresh beans with dedication to coffee making is hard to find, especially in this area of Hong Kong. Unlike the coffee shop in the Hong Kong Island, this is less commercialized and allow you a good time to slowly enjoy coffee for it best consumption."
Urban Coffee Roaster,4,"Urban Coffee Roaster feels a friend making coffee for you in their living room. I love how homey it feels. One could argue that it's split into three sections: the front area that has the coffee, tea, and other baked goods, the middle area that has one small table and a winding stairwell to what I assumed is a stock room, and the back section that has a big rectangular table that's good for big parties. There are many bookcases, paintings, statues, and random knickknacks around to create that homey feel.Because of the unbearable temperatures, I ordered an iced flat white and it was a surprisingly large portion. Even to the very last drop, the flat white had a deliciously strong coffee flavor and was not watered down at all. I thoroughly enjoyed it.Because of the location (7ish minute walk from the C2 exit of the Prince Edward MTR station), I'm not sure I would frequent this place but if you happen to be in the area then this is definitely worth visiting."
Urban Coffee Roaster,4,"A refreshing little oasis located in between the old Hong Kong suburbs of Sham Shui Po and Prince Edwards. Despite being in the middle of nowhere and far away from the cafe crowd, I found their flat white is full of single origin flavour with a punch. In addition to coffee, you will also discover local creativities in the shop with curated goodies from talented designers. One thing I couldn't figure out is the decorated space behind the cafe, could be a coworking space or bike repair area"
Toolss,5,Finally had a chance to visit this place! Super cute coffee shop that sells coffee and stationary! They don't sell food though so my friend and I asked the barista for recommendations and he happily told us a few local popular restaurants. Think pictures speaker louder than words just look at the pics :)
Toolss,4,"~Location It's located in a little corner of a less busier street. If you're looking for a place with a surrounding that's as cute as the coffee shop itself, this would not be the place to go to. ~Ambiance The seating is solely outdoor only. There's 6 seats on the counter, but that's outside too. So there's constantly people walking, sounds of cars, and the worst part was smokers. The coffee shop itself is really cute, but I can't say the same for its surroundings. ~ServiceIt was my first time here and the girl working was really friendly and patient with me.  ~Coffee I ordered the lychee latte and I really enjoyed it! There was a hint of lychee, and it was just perfect. Nothing was overwhelming."
Glorious Cuisine,5,"Michelin rated seafood in HK.Came here for the ""metta"" shrimp. Prices were medium to high. Location had plenty of family style seating in a casual atmosphere.We ordered the squid paste in doughnut as it was one of the highest rated items. I actually felt his dish was not necessary. All you could taste was the fried grease from the doughnut.We also had the soy sauce chicken, roasted goose, shrimp, and veggie won tofu and mushrooms.Everything is cooked fresh to order.Soy chicken is a must, but order as soon as you sit down as it takes a while. Shrimp cake topped with fried bread crumbs. Tasty but a lot of work to cut the shell and get to the meat."
Glorious Cuisine,5,"My relatives brought me to this restaurant to have a late dinner otherwise I would not have found it myself.  It was seriously a local establishment, one that I would have probably skipped over if I was browsing on Yelp.  The items on the menu reminded me of comfort food.This restaurant was totally unique.  1) The kitchen is outside, in the street.  2) The bathrooms were outside, at the side of the restaurant; you have to enter from the alleyway!  3) They serve fish intestines?!   So it was quite an experience. Onto the dishes:1) fish intestines- I believe it was cooked with eggs and fried cruller.  It was served in a casserole dish.  It was tasty, to an extend.  Very fishy in flavor, and soft in texture.  I would eat it again, but I would not voluntarily order it.2) deep fried fish - love this.  It was delicious and the fish had a bit of bones in it so it was definitely pieces of fish as opposed to just fillets.3) fried tofu -  I love tofu and this dish was top notch in my opinion.  Each of the tofu cubes had a crispy yet thin layer of fried skin.  The tofu was soft and silky, with almost the flavor of tofu dessert. Simple dish done right. 4)fried oysters - what's not to love about oysters?5)fish soup - flavorful and spicy since there was a lot of black pepper seasoning. Lots of clams and such in the soup.6) soy sauce chicken - this was the first dish we ordered and the last dish we received.  You have to order this as soon as you sit down because it is made on the spot.  You won't get a pre made chicken that has been hanging in the window all day long.  The chicken was very tender and the soy sauce was very flavorful, more sweet than salty since the it was sweetened with brown sugar.Overall, it was a very good meal.  The dining room was full even thought we sat down around 9pm for a very late dinner.  Lots of cars were double parked outside, so it seems like  this restaurant is a popular locate late hangout/dinner spot."
小菜王,5,"One of the few maybe less than a handful or two of these ""Dai Pai Dong"" left in the city. Definitely genuine style cooking. FAST and cheap ! great for dinner or late night gatherings for some food and beer. What makes this place different from most restaurants is their kitchen is OUTSIDE. When you are near by, you WILL hear the ROARING flame of the fire from the individual wok areas they have. My family in HK had brought us here for dinner during our visit in April 2016. We had just came here just early enough before the rush. We got a table almost instantly. Yes this place still has lots of outdoor seating but what surprised me is how brightly lit and clean the interior areas were as well. Whats funny is ive ate next door before this place existed 10 years ago. XD Same concept place. You can go around and view the chef's working their magic with the wok on the volcano of a stove. Some will even particularly give you some extra ""show"". It makes them happy some people are still interested. We had ordered a few things. honey sauce/glazed pork chops, deep fried pig intestine, stuffed fried tofu and eggplants, steamed garlic shrimp, deep fried milk fish, malaysia style on choy, and salted egg & garlic yin choy. To my surprise though not too surprised... my favs were (in no particular order) the deep fried milk fish, deep fried pig intestine, and steamed garlic shrimp. Pork chops. Nothing too special. sweet savoryish sour sauce with pork chop. Deep fried pork intestine - not special but something i havent had in a long time so it was nice and tasty XD Fried stuffed eggplant and tofu - nothing too special, similar to what i make at home too. Salted egg with garlic yin choy - not so common vegetable in the state but still available. this particular one had red leaves too. ive only seen the green leaved version. Simple dish in a broth. Nice and lightMalaysia style on-choy - to be honest, not sure what the sauce is. But ive noticed the malaysia style tends to have dried baby shrimp and chili. Lol Steamed garlic shrimp - simple. TONS of garlic. though i expected the shrimp to be bigger in comparison to the picture that was on the wall. but omg so tasty. THAT GARLIC *drools* om nom nom hahaha Deep fried milk fish - recommendation from my uncle. Ive never had it. Boneless (but as with all fish, id still be careful anyway). Lightly battered. Deep fried. The fish was light. Batter was crispy but light. It was really done well. Definitely a recommendation from me to others. Overall. Great place to eat at. As said, one of the last few left. If you are one who has been raised in the states, you may not like the chairs being plastic stools and you need to clean your own utensils and stuff. This particular location is a lot cleaner than i remember these places to be so im quite surprised. Especially the area it is in. Their order to table times are ridiculous. We had our entire order even faster than sometimes even one dish coming out in the states. Benefits of this style of cooking. SUPER fast. I've been told this place ONLY opens at night but i swear i heard the flame roaring mid-day another day when we were walking around near-by."
小菜王,4,"This place is one of those places you shouldn't miss - both as a tourist or a local - for an authentic dai pai dong experience.  It's cheap and great for large groups.  In fact, there were so many of us on the night we went we actually ended up occupying two tables!  Needless to say, we ended up ordering almost everything popular dish on their menu.  It's BYOB.  There is an old school convenient store just across the place selling most of the popular local beers - get a Tsingtao and forget about your foreign imports.  Common, you are at a dai pai dong!Food is delicious.  Even though the setting is a bit shady and there is always the fear a critter may decide to pop out from it's den to say ""hello"".  I think I might have seen a few cockroaches when we left but at least there were no rats running around... (Yes, they exist when there is food nearby.  It's just their nature.)  I didn't end up with any food poisoning so all is good."
小菜王,4,"This dai pai dong is one of the many that actually does most of their seating indoors, and they span across 4-5 shops next to each other. Although they are quite famous for their lamb pot, we decided to order other dishes so we could get a variety because the lamb pot is rather large and we would pretty much only be able to eat that. Next time.We ended up ordering a fried calamari, steamed fish belly, appetizer platter, and boiled spinach soup. The fried calamari came in a large portion and the squid was really fresh. The steamed fish belly was a little bit over cooked but still really soft and moist. You could also taste the freshness in the fish. The appetizer platter had deep fried pig intestine (really crispy), deep fried pork neck meat (great texture and flavor), and two other unidentifiable things. I think one is a green onion pancake and the other was a deep fried chicken patty. Whatever they were, they were good. I'm not a huge fan of deep fried foods so this platter definitely wasn't my favorite dish, but it was good. My favorite dish of the night has to be hands down the boiled spinach soup with minced meat. It could be that I love spinach though :P I thought it was very flavorful and I loved the salted egg that was in it. All in all, this place is a solid dai pai dong to visit and I can't wait to go back to try their famed lamb pot."
雲吞生麵食,5,"Looking for a place to eat in the Sham Shui Po district, we came across this local wonton mein (noodles) joint on Pei Ho Street. The prices on the wall advertised wonton mein for $19 ($2.50 US) a bowl and wonton soup for $24 ($3.10 US) a bowl.  There were quite a few people inside eating, so we thought we would give it a try.  We are glad we did.  You get three huge wontons in the bowl and quite a decent portion of noodles to go with it.  The noodles were al dente, just the way they should be and the wontons were delicious.  As a matter of fact, the wontons were the best of all the ones I have tried in Hong Kong.  Will definitely go back again for more delicious wontons in the future."
Prince Dragon,5,Great place for dim sum in Kowloon area. Clean place and the menu has no pictures and only written in chinese! Sucks for an ABC. Better than USA dim sum places
Prince Dragon,4,They serve Dim Sum. Must-try items include this: Abalone with Sui Mai. Follow my Yelp if you love my Yelping & welcome everybody to ask me questions about Hong Kong.
Wang Jia Sha,4,"It's a franchise, but very good one. Their cuisine is Shanghai. Very consistent."
Mad For Garlic,4,"I'm not exactly a big fan of garlic, let alone mad for it lol. I use garlic powder in my cooking here and there, but it is usually quite mild.My relatives brought me to Mad for Garlic inside Festival Walk this night because they love this restaurant. Knowing that I'm a foodie, they ordered many of their favourite dishes.We started with complimentary garlic bread. It was spread with the golden yellow garlic butter, but the bread was a bit chewy for my liking. I do like my bread crispy (sorry!)The creamy Garlic Carbonara Pasta was delicious. The spaghetti was done al dente, the cream sauce was nice and rich... I couldn't really pay attention to the garlic part tho lol.Onto the pizzas, we ended up ordering 3! I would highly recommend the 2nd pizza :) but all 3 were pretty tasty!1. BBQ Chicken Ranch Pizza is topped with spicy grilled chicken, cheese, arugula! This one had a spicy kick to it, watch out ;)2. Garlic Snowing Pizza is made with sweet white sauce, fried garlic, shrimp, and pineapple - this was my favourite one!3. Gorgonzola Cheese Pizza aka blue cheese pizza and served with honey dipping sauce! Quite smelly but tasted great.After dinner, I was talking to my friends about Mad for Garlic, but none of them really enjoyed this place. They would visit once a year maybe if a craving comes along. But the real turn off they mentioned was the dessert (cake)... somehow they incorporated garlic in it too. Sounds like a turn off for me. Luckily, our table didn't order any dessert this night. So, overall, the meal was a 4 star :)"
津津好金の味,5,"This was one of my favorite places to eat while in HK.  The people here are extremely friendly and serve up food that the locals like to package and take to work for the day. This is a small street stall on the corner and they can set up a table and some chairs for you.  I would grab a juice down the street or something from 7-11 because you might be burning up after some of this ""ma-la"" szechuan flavor.I would recommend the cold spicy noodles. The noodles are soooo good. Al-Dente. The spice is a ""ma-la"" type, which has some numbing and direct heat.  I think the mild isn't very spicy at all.  If you get the spicy, you'll probably be able to enjoy the bowl but you won't really enjoy the bowl when you're sitting on the bowl.  You can win the battle but not the war ;).  I also liked the spicy wontons as they're sitting in this delicious broth of ma-la flavoring.  Be careful of this one, as the spice really warms up the belly.  A must stop if you're in the neighborhood!"
Lady M,4,Super fluffy and creamy cake. Good thing is the wait time at  this location is not as crazy long as TST
Famous Dim Sum,5,Fantastic dim sum!  We were trying to go to One Dim Sum but the line was too long.  This place is right next door and had amazing food with good prices.  The custard bun was sooo creamy and good.  The taro and BBQ pork buns were also delicious.  You won't regret going here over the other!
Famous Dim Sum,5,Fantasic little restaurant. Stopped in here after seeing the insane line for One Dim Sum and did not regret it! The staff was helpful and speedy and the food was fantastic. A great treat for lunch on a rainy October day.
Famous Dim Sum,4,"We went here by accident because we were trying to find their more famous neighbor One Dim Sum.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Ordered the har gaw, siu mai, pork buns, shrimp rice rolls, and radish cake and felt all were well prepared.  Service was good too!!"
Café & Meal Muji,4,"In all honesty, I can't say I was a regular at Muji as no frills and minimalism is not exactly my style.  I like cute stationaries and things that spell KAWAII, so everything at MUJI just feel so boring to me.  However, on a recent trip to Muji I am surprised how many interesting things they have.  MUJI may mean no brand, but don't think that means cheap.  Their goods are rather pricey, though arguably of better material and workmanship.  We were in need of a luggage strap, so we figure, why not just buy it here?  Well, it's $138. It may be recycled material and nice design, but that's a lot more than your average strap for $30 or less.  Many of their clothes, made of linen and cotton and in basic colors, gives a very soft, natural look, but can easily look wrinkled and dull on one person unless you know how to wear them. We did find some nice shirts.  My hubby bought some shirts on sale, but when he wanted to exchange them the very next day for a larger size, we were told that sale items cannot be returned or exchanged.  A policy we find a bit strict, especially as we are used to the generous policies in American stores, but oh well.   They also have lots of snacks and food that looks very interesting, as well as books all over the place. Most of the books promote a Muji lifestyle, including Marie Kondo's books on decluttering, books on how to cook the food you can buy at Muji, and how to sew your own Muji style clothes! There is also a dining area where you can order full meals, and a cafe for a coffee or juice."
Cafe 360,5,"Café 360 is an Americanized Western café that serves fusion-type dishes. Located in Dragon Centre in Sham Shui Po, Café 360's menu and food offerings certainly draw in a crowd. I would say that the interior (and cute exterior) is very typical to what you'd see in the hip, trendy LA Asian American cafés - pretty quotes on the wall, cute decorations, dim lighting. This is definitely a good date place - and you can roam the mall after! I came with my family during their afternoon teatime, thinking that there would be some specials offered around 2 PM. I think they had a lunchtime special, so even at 2 PM, the restaurant was packed with customers and guests waiting for a seat. After you're seated at a table, you have to go to the front counter to order your food. You're given a number, and when the food is ready the waiter/waitress will serve the food to your table. Since it's Hong Kong and you can split dishes without anybody really caring, we decided to order fewer items to be shared amongst ourselves and eat elsewhere if we were still hungry. Porcini rice with pork and kimchi in stone pot: $46 HKD and with an additional $12 HKD, we were able to add on a puff pastry soup. I have to say that the rice was really good. Very similar to the Chinese sausage in a stone pot, except this rice had flavoring and ingredients to it. Along with the pork belly and kimchi - flavoring of everything was on point, and it definitely filled us up. Cream of mushroom puff pastry soup: When the waitress brought our soup to us, one of them was slightly burnt, and without us even commenting, she said that she was going to ask the chef to remake a new one for us. I don't think we would have really minded, but that was really nice of her. The soup is definitely something you must try! Rich flavoring of mushroom in a creamy broth. The puff pastry was light and flaky, with really good flavor. As you break into the puff pastry, some of it drops into the soup so you get a crispy texture as you drink the creamy soup. I really liked it. Spaghetti Bolognese with puff pastry soup: This set lunch combination was $56 HKD or roughly $8 USD. I thought it was fairly priced, since it came with the puff pastry soup. The spaghetti wasn't too unique. Tasted very similar to how my mom cooks her spaghetti, except it was slightly sweeter. I probably wouldn't recommend ordering this dish if you're looking for something unique or different to try. Hot tea and hot milk tea - nothing special. The hot milk tea was pretty strong, but not as smooth as some of the other places I've tried. tl;dr - Overall, a really cute place to go for lunch or brunch. They also serve waffles and breakfast items. I really like the interior design of the place. The workers are super nice and friendly. Highly recommend if you're looking for a nice place for brunch!"
Cafe 360,4,"A good western food choice in the middle of your local Sham Shui Po district . Cafe 360 is located on the 7th floor of Dragon Center next to Genki Sushi . They serve surprisingly good western food choice ! On the night that I went, the salmon steam tomato omelette rice ( omrice) was on special meaning it came with free drink and soup (!) We also ordered the baked spaghetti which was pretty tasty .Would highly recommend this place and would definitely want to try other things on their menu . Personally I think it is good value for the quality of food and the ambiance you'd get. But if you are talking bout about relativity, it is rather expensive compared to other choices you can get in Sham Shui Po .( I don't think anyone should travel all the way just to try this place )"
Cafe 360,5,"Friendly staff, good food, but best of all was the Pink Himalaya Salt Coffe! Omg, I'm in love!"
Ma’s Restaurant,4,"Ma's Restaurant is unique because it serve halal Chinese food. Although not the most fancy restaurant, the food it serves is top notch.We had their sesame pancake, which was delicious. It was perfectly crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. I loved how fragrant the sesame was. We also had their lamb wrap, and we were pleasantly surprised at how crispy the wrap was and with the sweet hoisen sauce inside. Next, we had their beef goulash which is like a pan fried bun with beef inside. The goulash was super juicy and the beef was well seasoned. Lastly, we had a dan dan noodle with ox tongue. The soup base wasn't too spicy and noodles were al dente. The ox tongue was also fresh. Above anything else, all of the servers at the restaurant were really friendly and helpful. They proactively advised us on things we should order and ways to eat it. If you're in this area, I would give this place a try."
Ma’s Restaurant,4,This establishment serves halal food and everything tasted great.  The lamb racks were fried well and accompanied with mustard.  The beef tripe in xo sauce was somewhat spicy.  The lamb goulash was filled with liquid and nice flavor.  The samosas were also good.
Ma’s Restaurant,4,"Nice and clean restaurant. My friend says this is a Muslim Chinese cuisine from the northwest region. Flavored quite different from normal Cantonese food especially the stir fried beef onion (see picture). They have English in their menu, but don't expect much oral English as this place is off the tourist locale."
Eat Together,4,"Great place for what it is! Nice place to go for a cheap little dine in with good food! Nothing spectacular, but like I said, great for what it is. I enjoyed."
Eat Together,4,"I used to eat here regularly in Hong Kong. For the price you can't beat their curry tendon. Not too clean at times, and as the name implies, they will seat you with other people if there are no open tables lol. I've tried the other locations too, but this was always my favorite. :)"
文記車仔麵,4,"The lines for ""Man Kee"" are always insane at night. Or at least it seems insane. FRET NOT. It's actually only long because you have to order right at the entrance before you're seated, hence the long line outside. There was actually not that many people eating inside because they had to prepare everyone's customized orders individual. Like the previous Yelper L L. mentioned. This little place is a classic Hong Kong-style ""street cart noodle"" 車仔麵 shop which is basicallly a DIY noodle shop. You get to choose whatever ingredients you want + type of noodles (i.e. egg noodles, udon, rice noodles, flat rice noodles, etc.) You just pay per ingredient.I know all the Chinese written on the walls intimidate a lot of people, cough including me. But don't worry, a lot of the street cart noodle shops sell similar things. You can refer to Wikipedia for typical cart noodle ingredients: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca… . My personal favorites are Beef  Tendon, Radish, Fish Ball and some veggies. All the ingredients really hit the spot and were really tender and juicy. The egg noodles I got here were on the ""meh"" side but of course it can't compare to egg noodle specialty restaurants.One more thing, this place is pretty famous for their ""Swiss"" style chicken wings 瑞士雞翼 (it's a sweet soy sauce flavor) and they are so delicious. They're a little pricier than the other ingredients but it's worth it!"
文記車仔麵,3,"Please prepare to queue up. It took us about 35min or so for getting our seats. Pretty much that u pick whichever topping you like, and added into your bowl of noodle. Overall, not a bad one for me. Once a while, ok to eat here that is for sure."
文記車仔麵,4,"They had 3 shops down the same street. Very small and tight in there. I came here with my cousin's and aunt. Surprisingly we were able to sit together. It was a quick meal, in and out. There was so many protein options I can pick. Very delish."
文記車仔麵,4,"There was always lines every time I passed by.   It is shorter early and late but very long during the peak meal hours.   Curious, I decided to give it a try.   It is the authentic Hong Kong style ""street cart"" food - classic!    You first have to select type of noodles that you want (the selection was pretty incredible).   Then, you will select the items that you want.   May sure you order the veggie at the time you select your noodles as they will need to cook it.  I had several items = including their famous (according to the sign) Swiss chicken wings.   It came out pretty reasonable and pretty good.   After they assemble your custom order, there is one person collect your money and bring the bowl to a table with you (it was hot).    There is a similar restaurant next door (and I tried it too) - and I think this is definitely better - thus the line all the time."
Ju Xing Home,5,"This place is freaking amazing! A chef friend of mine brought us here for dinner one night. The restaurant opens at 5pm and goes until the wee hours of the night. On any given night, you'll find TVB (HK television) celebrities and Chinese Michelin-starred chefs dining here. The food is incredible. Owner/Chef Ng is so passionate in everything he prepares -- he's the only one in the kitchen cooking -- and it is reflected in the dishes that hits the table.We had clam soup, spicy chicken, roasted pigeon, soy sauce prawns, sour and spicy garoupa, pan fried vermecelli with black bean abalone, and gailan with salted fish. This is home-style cooking at its very best!"
Ju Xing Home,5,"Highly recommend this place for dinner. Food is very reasonable, service is great. You can bring your own wine as well. Location is easy to find.  MTR off Prince Edward exit D, only a minute walk. Oh I should mention the food is Delicious as well. Fresh seafood, good beef dish and great vegetables. Try it!!"
Nam Shan Shopping Centre Cooked Food Stalls,3,Value for money. Food is ok. The dinner set comes with 2 bowls of rice so it is good for people with a huge appetite. There is space to park your bikes outside that's why we made a stop there and dinner.
Nom Nom Dumpling,5,"My favorite kind of dumplings -- thin skin, abundant filling -- and none broke. ;-) We ordered the meal set -- dumplings with signature soup, as well as potstickers with soup, and wontons. English on the menu as well. Great for dine-in (preserved veggies in a mason jar, help yourself with the tongs!), or takeout raw or cooked dumplings."
Nom Nom Dumpling,4,Around the bend... around the corner from our hotel!Ordered: - Nom Nom Dumplings Noodle Soup (comes with 6 pieces). $42 HKD ~ $5.79 USD. Tina's Travel and Tabloid- Located on Boundary Street near the Prince Edward MTR Station ~ 3 minute walk. - Be specific when ordering or you'll end up with dumplings in a soup base versus pan-fried. Double doesn't mean both steamed and fried.- Specialty in matsutake dumpling making aka mushroom dumplings.- Variety of choices of dumplings for sure!- Communal seating! The waitresses are so patient and nice. :)- Mom and I almost went here every day for brunch. It was delicious and you can see them work through the glass window! Very entertaining for the young ones.
Nom Nom Dumpling,4,"All the dumplings are handmade, and the variety is rich, such as truffle dumplings, cheese dumplings, etc. Welcome traveler to ask me questions about Hong Kong & follow my Yelp if you love my Yelping."
She Wong Sin,5,"This is a snake soup place in Sham Shui Po which seems to be pretty well regarded. My local friend took me to try this and it was surprisingly really tasty... I wouldn't know what snake would taste like before this but nothing tipped me off that it was a weird animal I was eating. No strange flavor, just tasty. Not like I would crave it but I would eat it mainly for the supposed health benefits of snake flesh.  Plus props for the decor too. Not like it's amazing or beautiful, but the atmosphere was really classic Hong Kong and this would be a good place to try snake soup and then take some interesting pics of the snake displays and stuff. Super cheap too, like most of the stuff in Sham Shui Po."
She Wong Sin,4,"Not quite as good as the place in Central but at $38.. What a bargain. I'm wondering around sham shi Po in cold January & came across snake skins & belts hanging outside. Then looked inside & saw the snake soup... So I had to try it... To get warm.The snake does not taste as fresh as the other place but it was full. Soup comes in small/38, medium/54 & large/70. I tried the small as I had just had lunch.Other customers are mostly men but there were woman & a family.Keep this place in the back of my mind for winters in SSP"
糖水佬甜品,4,I had a satisfying dessert with a mango pudding base and assorted fruits and other elements on top.  Was excellent and not inordinately sweet.
西九龍中心美食廣場,3,"Just like the rest of the mall, you won't find too many chains at the food court here!  I have yet to try all the different offerings but you can tell this place is popular just by how crowded it is!  If anything, it's cheap to eat here!"
PizzaExpress,1,"Really bad and disrespect service attitude. No smile, everything is slow, you gonna wait over 20,minutes after you told them to check. Hopeless , I wouldn't come anymore"
PizzaExpress,1,"The service was decent, the waitress was very polite. However the food was horrendous and is not worth the price they are charging. First we ordered their dough balls with a salmon and cucumber dip. While the dough balls were nicely baked, the dip was very bland, tasted of smoked salmon and nothing else. There was no balance of flavors and textures whatsoever. The entrees we ordered were a pasta with picked crab and a seafood lasagne. The pasta with crab was completely bland, seasoning was practically nonexistent, just spicy and nothing else. I could tell that the spaghetti noodles were overcooked before I even took a bite of it. The seafood lasagne my friend ordered was just plain disgusting. There were more vegetables in it that there was seafood, and worst of all it was submerged in a layer water (presumably from the veg)...... Yea. Water. The whole experience was not pleasurable and I'm not planning a return to pizza express anytime soon"
Tong Kee Bao Dim,5,"A place where you can go to satisfy your dim sum cravings at random hours during the day.I stumble on Tong Kee Bao Dim by accident after spending a few hours at Sham Shui Po. I definitely had no intention of eating, but once I saw the pictures of the food, I knew I had to order something. Prices are definitely reasonable, and the food is fresh no matter what time of the day you go. And do note that this is definitely not a sit down place to eat that delicious dim sum though!"
Tong Kee Bao Dim,5,Great take-out place!!! I get my big steamed buns and beef ball in tofu skin.  Also glutinous rice with chicken and roasted pork.  My favorite steamed bun is the Lotus and sweet potatoes!!!
川之味麻辣米線,5,Absolutely marvelous Szechuan food. Off the touristy beaten path - this is clearly a loved locals spot. Portions are huge and fairly priced. And when they say spicy - they mean spicy!!I got the mala niurou. It was divine.
Sher Wong Yip,4,"I was steered here by Nicole C.'s review (yelp.com/biz/蛇王業-香港?hrid…) and I'm glad I made it, both to see the neighborhood and to try the snake soup.I think the neighborhood (Sham Shui Po) doesn't get much tourism, but it's interesting to walk around.  It's only maybe a 30-minute walk from here back down to Yau Ma Tei or Jordan, areas you're more likely to pass through as a tourist, so it's not even that far away, but walking that distance uncovers tons of industry--tarp sewing, heavy metal working, bike mechanics, construction materials prep--on top of all the other usual city stuff and some small wet markets.  My point is, coming here and then walking back will give you a nice little tour of Kowloon.As for the soup--hand to heart, I promise you, it tastes like chicken.  A bit tougher and chewier, yes, but there's nothing remotely gross here.  It's a hearty, rich meat soup that looks not unlike a hot n' sour soup you might get in an American Chinese takeout place.  Go for it."
Sher Wong Yip,4,"Sher Wong Yip Snake Shop was featured on Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern... and you guessed it-- they serve snake related edibles! Snake soup is regarded as having restorative properties, which sounded like something I desperately needed at the end of a 3-week trip to Asia...Located in Sham Shui Po (a more local part of Hong Kong), it's a bit off the tourist path, but still easy to find. You'll know you're there when you see the cage with a live cobra in the front!We walked into the small shop which was mostly empty except for a few elderly locals, and we each ordered a bowl of snake soup. It was a thick, aromatic broth with ample chunks of snake meat, mushrooms, and herbs. The snake meat is mild in flavor and has the texture of a mix between chicken & fish. It was a small bowl, but it was very hearty and warming. Yum! The owner, Gibson Cheung, also stopped by our table to chat. He was super friendly, and spoke English surprisingly well. He was very enthusiastic about his shop, and he was interested in how we heard of it. He explained that it's his family's business, and he's the 3rd generation owner! At the end of our meal, he even gave us a mini tour of the place.A great experience; I would recommend Sher Wong Yip to anyone who is an adventurous eater, or who want a taste of Chinese tradition, or who just need a boost in HP!"
Sher Wong Yip,4,I always come here for their snake soup when I'm in HK. Don't be afraid to try snake because it taste like chicken and it's shredded in the soup so skin involved. TIP: add the crunchy noodle and shredded lemongrass provided at each table!! It really makes the yummy soup even more yummier.
Take A Break Cafe,3,Stepped into the small cafe with interesting interior design. The coffee is nice. Friendly service.See if you notice the intriguing lamps. ;)
Sushi Take Out,5,"The sushi here is so good and cheap. It can also be fresh. If you are in a rush, you can always grab some sushi on the go. You can find a Sushi Take Out in a few stations close to the MTR.They have this salmon rolls with mayo and masago that are the bomb. I always get it everytime I come to Hong Kong.Individual sushi is HK$3 each."
Sushi Take Out,5,"WHAT. Coming from the US, I do not have access to 6pc sushi rolls for $2.5USD ($20HK). I am in awe!!!!I've tried a variety of the pre-packed rolls and the individual rolls. Everything is fresh and sauces/mayos are delicious."
Sushi Take Out,3,"Japanese food in Hong Kong has been milked for its worth- for too long anyone or any place that sell some raw pieces of fish could define itself a ""Japanese"" restaurant. Sushi is now so widely available that its just not something special anymore. Sushi express is the perfect illustration of my point. You can find this place in every MTR station and the same scene is replayed- you will find 3 HKD sushis and a million people packed into the shop trying to pick out the bargains they see before their eyes. They offer a lot too- you get sushi, sashimi and even rice boxes. The prices they offer are a fraction of which you would pay at a normal sushi shop so this place does make sense as a staple.The thing is though- I have no problem with sushi on the cheap- is the fact that we are know its not fresh and with sushi that's a major problem. Sushi is a delicate item that could not be done on the cheap and this kind of ruins the whole point of having sushi. As somewhere to fill up your stomach quick and cheap I guess this place could not be beaten. However, would I call this real Japanese food? Well its as Japanese as McDonalds and I'll probably have the latter if I can help it."
Yu Mai,5,My order: Fishball and Pork in spicy and sour rice noodles soup Pros+ AC+ Price: 51$ HKD with a drink+ Seating: comfy booths+ Food: refreshing! I loved the sweet and spicy pairingCons- Toilet: one unisex stall to the end of the restaurant
Yu Mai,4,"The portions here are huge and the price is quite cheap. Overall the food was quite decent. We got a regular noodle soup, a fish soup and fried fish. The fish wasn't too oily, however the flavours were just mediocre, nothing too special. The place was clean and comfortable. It's a good place to go for a quick meal that doesn't feel like fast food"
OMQ Dining Room,5,"I was already excited to see the statues of the characters in the entrance, and seeing the dining area makes you feel as if you've walked into an Old Master Q theme park! I've seen a few cafes that have nice decorations to fit the theme, but this is all out! Even the chairs and tables give you the comic book vibe. Each area you sit in has a different aspect of the comic, so my parents ended up taking pictures all around the restaurant. The service is also very nice and attentive, which is something you don't expect to see often in Hong Kong. The food is generally western themed and so I got a salmon noodles with passion fruit tea. My dish was so delicious I gobbled it quickly. The passion fruit drink was refreshing and not too sweet, but still tasty! My dad and sister got curry and my mom got club sandwiches. All of these were yummy and filling. Oh, and my dad's mocha looked and tasted like a sweet milkshake. In the end, we decided to purchase some OMQ merchandise they were selling at the cash register area. I highly recommend this place if you're an OMQ fan!"
OMQ Dining Room,3,"A good friend of mine invited me to have dinner here whilst I was in town and her choice did not disappoint. OMQ Dining Room is a themed cafe based on the iconic Hong Kong cartoon from the 60s called Old Master Q. This place is very hard to miss as there is a huge statue of OMQ greeting you as you walk up via Nathan road from the MTR. This place was packed when we got here and we had to wait about 30 minutes before being seated. I was surprised at the level of detail here and supposedly the owner got the full blessing from the cartoon's creator on every visual aspect. Even the menus were in the shape of OMQ and there was art detailing on the chairs!The food served was pretty iconic Hong Kong-style Western cuisine. For starters, we had the pigeon and escargot which were just okay. It was definitely a first to have tried escargot on mushrooms on a bed of mashed potatoes. For the main course, we had Baked Chicken Rice in Portuguese style sauce and Baked Spaghetti Bolognese with Cheese. Both were simply good, nothing amazing. The mains almost came out immediately after the appetizers so we didn't get a chance to properly indulge in the starters. I'm also minusing one star because they forgot about our dessert and it took more than 30 minutes for it to arrive. Other than that, it was a great local spot and if you grew up on the cartoon, it will definitely evoke some memories as you dine here."
OMQ Dining Room,4,"Great concept. Master Q, a comic book from 60s. However, I was still reading it and watching their cartoons from the 80s and 90s. Also, I am still searching for old black and white Master Q movies from Youtube. Oh Yes! Still making me laugh. This place brought back our childhood memories. I went on 10/1/2016. Waited in line for only 5 mins before they open, took me 2 mins to be seated. Reminiscent interior, great place for pictures. I really like their idea for the menu. Each dishes on the menu has a name, used the title of each chapter of the comic book. People who read Master Q will understand. It is a traditional Hong Kong style westernized food restaurant. I went with a friend of mine. We ordered one drink and one dessert with cotton candy on top of it, purple yam drink and swiss chicken wings. The food was pretty good. Service was okay. Seats were comfortable. They have SUPER TINY restrooms but looks clean. ( Well, this is Hong Kong. Everything is tiny!! ) However, one thing important to mention. This restaurant is not a disable friendly place. The restaurant is on the second floor with no elevator or escalator. ( Again, this is Hong Kong. The government doesn't have complete laws and mentalities to protect people with disability yet!  Especially for buildings and restaurants!!  ) My dad likes Master Q but I don't think I can take him there with all the stairs. Okay! The very great part is the restaurant has good access to public transportation. It is only  steps away from the Prince Edward Station MTR. I took the bus from Causeway Bay. I just got off right across the street with one bus. The Master Q banner was very hard to miss. Indeed, they sell souvenirs, too : ) !!"
J.S. Foodies,3,"A weird mix of burgers & pancakes, J.S. Foodies is new on the scene in Hong Kong.  The burgers are flavorful & juicy, with a freshly baked bun.  I've yet to try the savory pancakes, including the seasonal special lobster pancakes, but the soufflé pancakes were lovely and light.  I'd recommend the ""kiseki"" pancakes with strawberries, blueberries, bananas & fresh clotted cream.The reason why I've only offered three stars is that there are still many kinks in operation.  Of note, unnecessarily long queues / wait times even during non-peak hours, but multiple empty seats / tables throughout the restaurant.  On our last visit, we were asked for the number of people in our party 3x by the same staff member within 15 minutes (she was writing this down, how she needed to re-ask everyone in the queue is beyond me).  We ended up being seated after a lengthy wait at the same bar table by the window that had been cleared, set & empty for the past 30 minutes.  On the food front, the kitchen appears to be working much faster.  For this reason, we ordered dessert after we finished our meal.  The soufflé pancakes -- made fresh to order, came out in around 20 minutes.  J.S. Foodies is a casual spot, so the pace of the kitchen worked well.  I'd def be back -- perhaps in a few months time, and hope that they will be running much more smoothly then."
Feed Your Nerves,4,"Excellent little cafe. The menu is Chinese only, and being the Chinese-illiterate that I am, the staff was happy to read it out to me. The upstairs is really cool, everyone sits on the floor in long tables to hang out. More cafes should have this style.Food was pretty good, I got the first food item on the menu ($98, not sure what it's called) and an ""iced apple vinegar kiwi soda"". Drink was quite sour, but I liked that."

Feed Your Nerves,4,This is a really nice little cafe. Meals and drinks were put together with heart. A tranquil and cozy decor. There's a quiet space where u can lounge upstairs. There are toilets outside but it's a nice one. Staff here seems to put a real effort into the product they put out which is nice to see for a change. Will return for those awesome looking cakes!
Kowloon Restaurant,3,"Been to this place in sham shui po twice. It is one of those typical local ""cha chan teng"" ( local Chinese cafe) in HK and inexpensive. The cafe makes their own selection of canto bakery which is not common with most in HK . It is also the reason I came back . Along with the famous pineapple bun with butter ( served on ice !!), they also have cocktail bun ( sweet bun with coconut innards ), coconut tart, egg tart etc. I would highly recommend the satay beef noodle set ( A set, hkd 26) which is my ultimate favourite. on my rating for this noodle, I would give the restaurant 3.5/5 :)! Note : if you change your drink to ice/ cold, It is a standard in HK that surcharge hkd2 is added"
Kashmir Curry House,5,"Hot damn! It looks a bit unassuming from the outside, but this place knows what they are doing. Simply amazing curries and parathas. Lamb Biryani which included a bit of bone with easily removed marrow! So tasty. The beef samosa was soft and flaky, absolutely wonderful!Worth the trip to Sham Shui Po just to eat here"
Running Chicken,5,"There are many hotpot styles out there, but have you heard of a cheesy chicken hotpot? You heard right. This local resturants serves chicken and cheese in a pot. Cooked in front of you and friends, you can smell the cheese and onion emerging from the pot as you wait - but only for a few minutes. Once you're done, you can ask the server to add some broth so you can do a yummy cheese-filled hotpot. Dip some beef, tofu, fresh meatballs in!"
Running Chicken,4,"Chicken was prepared in a pot with Sze chuan spice and peppers- tasty but a bit dry. Then left over is use as the base for hot pot- very tasty. The wanton and prawn balls are my favourite as it was marinated and process that it is so bouncy and shrimp very fresh . Love it.The famous Beef was a bit thicker then I like , if the soup is not flavored, I don't seem to get the taste of the beef. The 'liong cha' drinks are best for hot pot as it cools the system down . Like that a lot ."
Semua Semua,4,"Great street-standard Malaysian not far from the Golden Computer Arcade in SSP. Fast and tasty. Alleyway seating, good for solo or pairs. Practical - food is passed to the bench via a hatch to the kitchen. Authentic flavours, nice variety. Chicken curry was fragrant and lightly spicy. Loh bak was a little greasy but the filling was tasty and the ingredients distinctive. Loh See Fun with pin noodles was divine - sweet, savoury and those chewy pin noodles. Chicken wings were tasty - but soggy. Octopus accepted - as is cash. Picture menu in Chinese and English is simple and easy to navigate - but food is delivered in small cardboard tubs which don't quite look the same..."
Semua Semua,4,"The chicken satays with the accompanying sauce were excellent.  The lah bak, or pork roll, was a satisfying mix of meat and vegetables.  The otak otak, or fish cake, was interesting and a thin mass wrapped in banana leaf."
Emperor Chicken,3,"*Vegetarian-friendly. Cash ONLY.Ironically, I had just returned from Seoul a week before coming here, but after walking through the entire food court, I somehow found myself standing in line waiting for bibimbap. At first I was a bit worried, because it seemed that I was the only one waiting at this particular food stall...but then twenty minutes in, a horde of people began lining up behind me. I guess I beat the dinner rush hour? There is one cook and I don't know how she manages it, but she somehow gets through each and every order on her own.  She is so nice and gracious. I asked if I could get my bibimbap without pork and she kindly offered to give me an extra egg. There is a bit of a wait seeing as how she is the only one running the entire food stand, but she tries to serve everyone as quickly as possible.Of course, there is also the issue of hygiene but then again...this is Asia. If you eat at a food stand, don't expect the cook to clean the pots and pans every time they're cooking up a new dish. They just reuse the same pan, with the same old sauces left over from cooking the previous order, and the same spatula. There's nothing unusual about this. Regardless, pushing this thought to the back of my mind, my bibimbap turned out to be delicious. The hot sauce, the fried egg(s), the vegetables -- everything was put together nicely. Unlike the one I had in Seoul, this one had a Cantonese twist to it. Instead of providing kimchi, the cook added some picked squash and radishes. Still had that tangy spicy flavor, but just different texture. Comparably, I'd still have to say that the one I had in Korea was the best bibimbap by far. However, the one I had here was satisfying enough.4 stars for service, 3 stars for quality of food. Based upon my observations of the huge line waiting at this place AND from my own experience of eating here, this place is decent if you're craving some Korean."
滿串,4,The lamb and beef skewers were cooked very well with the spicier sauce being a better adjunct compared to the clearer one.
Dai Kee,4,Liked:- broth and fresh noodles- quick and no frills service- fish cakes- sweet snacks up by registerThis place was listed in the Hong Kong tourism board local delicacies guide. Very close to Prince Edward MTR station.
Golden Phoenix Restaurant,5,"Best HK style steak in HK. You might think it is weird to have garlic and sauce on your steak, and the smell of the restaurant, however, this is the old HK style steak house. A must try in Hong Kong.   Order steak fillet with pepper sauce, add HKD 2 for the garlic. For $80hkd you get steak fillet cooked to perfection. Must try in hkReviewed by a CBC. This is better than the keg or Baton Rouge if you know what I'm saying."
New Order,4,"The duck and foie gras risotto was bursting with sauvignon chardonnay goodness without losing its balance. 5 stars. The beef burger, being my favorite comfort food, was, unfortunately overly soft and comforting (even the bacon was soft and not crispy). 3 stars. Service was first class. Prices were about average. Overall 4 stars. Wish Yelp had a slightly more sophisticated rating system."
New Order,3,"This place is now called ""Years"" and it's vegetarian /plant based restaurant :( vegetarian. Sorry to see the change."
Pacific Coffee Company,1,"Had half an hour between appointments so thought I would grab a quick tall green tea. Turns out you need half an hour for this cup to cool down! Could barely carry it to the table without burning my hand and I know better than to scald my lip on this. What a waste.Why serve burning hot tea to a customer?  Especially if it's ""to-go""? Sadists."
Koon Thai Hai Nam Chicken,3,"This is a decent place for a quick meal.   Their signature dish - Hai Nan chicken - is well done.  I've No complaint.   If you like dark meat, you need to tell them and they will charge you HK$5 more.   They used traditional white rice and not the chicken essences soaked rice.  It is healthier but not as tasty.   Overall, good experience and good food."
Treasure City Hot Pot Seafood Restaurant,4,"The fried vegetable rice is the way to go. It's the best thing we had here. We also got chicken and mushroom buns and some meatball looking thing. We tried to order dim sum, but I guess we didn't get it right. Either way, if you find yourself here, the egg and vegetable fried rice (big one) is the way to go for 3 people. We also ordered 2 Tsingtao beers. It's noon on Tuesday and we're the only ones drinking. We almost ordered 3, but my mom didn't want anything. Turns out the beers we ordered are 21 ounces. So basically between my dad and I we each have our own 20 ounce tall boy beer."
Fairwood,3,"This chain is a good and cheap way to enjoy Chinese, Japanese, or Western favorites in a spacious and modern setting. No matter what time of day you're visiting, there's always great specials available to order for eating or drinking."
Amin Indonesian Restaurant,4,"Peanuts are my weakness so anything with peanut sauce is going to be a winner. This place is very generous with their peanut sauce. It's over their satays, over their vegetable salad, and even fruit salad. They ran out of chicken satay and their water spinach dish, which were both supposed to be good. They skimp on seafood, but that's no surprise.Favorite was definitely the salad with peanut sauce."
