Camper’s,5,"I find their style of food interesting and not something common I would see at restaurants, in particular, the rice sets.I've had beef and egg over rice, as well as the oxtail with vegetables with rice. Both were really good, and large portion sizes. When I was eating the oxtail with vegetables there were a lot of vegetables which I liked, but nearing the end I struggled to finish all my food as I was getting quite full (which says a lot, considering I generally can eat a lot).It gets quite busy for lunch and dinner so I would recommend going a bit earlier if you would like to avoid lines."
Camper’s,4,"Camper's has a simple menu consisting of Japanese curry rice and noodle dishes. My 4 star rating is based on the following:Food: 4 starsService/Environment: 3 starsValue: 5 starsRecommended dish: pork and vegetable curry with riceI have tried both the noodle and the rice sets and the rice dishes are by far superior.  A popular recommendation is the vegetable curry. If you are vegetarian than that is a tasty choice, but if you like meat than order a mix of meat and vegetable curry. The special pork (item 1 on the lunch set) is really good. The pork is fall off the bone tender and you just need a fork to cut the meat. The pork tastes like it is coming from the shank so you get a mixture of meat and tendon. At 69 hkd for the rice set plus a drink it really is a great deal. This place is really small and seating is limited. You will need to share a table with strangers if you eat here. Lots of places in Hong along are like this so this doesn't bother me much. If you want more privacy then this may not be the place forDuring lunch hours you will need to wait so get here before 12 if you don't want to wait in line."
Camper’s,4,Considered among the best cheap eats in the area among the locals. My cousin who lives in the city brought me here during my visit and sweared by the place. Got the slow cooked chicken cartilage with rice and eggs and absolutely loved it. The pork was super tender and juicy and the egg on the rice was a nice touch (this is extra). The meals came out quick as well. This is a very tiny place and they don't take reservations. Expect to wait outside if you arrive early and not all your party is there. It is camping themed.
Camper’s,4,"No frills, reasonably priced for HK restaurant that cooks Japanese comfort food. The veggie dish I had was well seasoned and came with a clear bone broth soup that reminded me of my childhood. The decor is nice and the seating is crowded with a sizeable line outside, but it's worth a 15 min wait."
Camper’s,5,"Cute, stylish Japanese restaurant, and quick service. The pork soft bone is incredibly tender in both the dinner set and the curry."
Camper’s,4,"Not sure where I read the write up on this spot, but my husband and I popped in around 1PM on a Saturday on our way to the Tim Burton exhibition at Taikoo Place.  There was about a 10 minute wait, for they were busy and there is probably seating for about 40 or so inside.  Pretty inexpensive and pretty interesting tasting food that advertises their approach to cooking as ""no additives, more vegetables and minimal fat.""  I had the veggie curry with rice and I would agree that the veggies were bountiful and more varied compared to similar places selling something similar.  Hot, fresh, fast, full of good veggies, affordable and more interesting tasting than your average lunch set...for a pescatarian like me, this check's all the boxes!  They are not doing anything culinarily outside the box at Camper's, but it tastes good and I think the treat is in its simplicity. The ambiance it outfitted for ""camping"" and their theme, which provides some ambiance outside the hospital white wall atmostphere of many easy, asian lunch joints. Staff wearing flannel checkered plaid, cashier wearing a fishing fat, bait and tackle gear on the wall, wooden cabin slats for walls.  They get kudos for a unique little theme...although not sure how it ties into Japanese Curry.  We will go back when we are in the area again."
Camper’s,5,This place was excellent for lunch.  My coworkers and I all enjoyed our dish.  I had the chicken curry with rice and they had ordered the slow roasted pork udon.  You could tell this restaurant takes a lot of pride in their food.  The meal was relatively inexpensive and tasted great.
Camper’s,4,"Camper is probably one of the top 3, if not most, popular lunch places in Quarry Bay. The name doesn't seem at all relevant for a curry restaurant, neither does the Chinese name make much more sense - 坐忘 literally means 'sit and forget'. The origins of the name are torturing me - if someone can shine a light on this please do tell me! While the name is confusing, the direction of the restaurant is definitely not - Camper is run by a Japanese chef who does Japanese ramen and curry (mostly curry I'd say) with a strict emphasis on high fiber, low fat and no msg. I've been here a couple times; usually arrive 12:15pm and wait 5-10mins to get seated. The curry is runnier than usual Japanese curries, more like a thick soup than a curry actually, and it is non-spicy, I wish they would have some chili oil or Tabasco on the side for some discretionary heat. Though the curry is known for being msg-less, the flavor is still quite present. Besides that, the portions are quite generous, and you get a massive helping of vegetables no matter what set you order. There is even a set lunch that is all vegetables. All the rice is mixed with sweet potato, corn and pumpkin for added fiber. Despite being a ramen place, I notice that most people here order curry. 3 stars for the flavors in general, but an extra star for the thoughtfulness in keeping everything healthy. People appreciate that and I think it already shows from the long lunch queue every day."
Camper’s,4,"Visited this place for lunch in a workday. As usual, there will be a 15-20 min wait for a table but ppl go in and out pretty fast for lunch so I think we waited about 15 min. I got the Chicken curry while my formed got the beef curry. The beef curry is more spicy and comes with peppers in the curry while the chicken curry was only a little spicy and came with zucchini, carrots, potato, cauliflower, and lots of green onion, which I enjoyed! The portion was decent sized and the chicken was grilled and pretty tender. However, I found this particular Japanese curry to be pretty bland tasting :( It's a cute little shop and a good place to go if you are trying to get your veggie fill for the day and I guess it's a healthy alternative cuz not much sodium! They also have udon and ramen so I'll give those a try another time."
Camper’s,5,Nice curry of mild spiciness. Consistent cooking through out years. The pork stew is nice too.
Camper’s,1,Customer service is not so great. Very HK style. I didn't appreciate the food. It didn't taste good at all. Although the place was full so perhaps I haven't adapted to HK tastebuds. I certainly don't recommend on returning.
Mr & Mrs Fox,4,"Mr and Mrs Fox is one of the few steakhouses/new American restaurants in the greater Quarry Bay Area.  I have eaten here a number of times and have tried the lunch, brunch, happy hour and dinner. Overall my rating is based on the following:Food: 4 starsEnvironment/service: 4 starsValue: 3.5 starsRecommendations: ribeye steak Happy hour (2 stars):It is really close to my office and is often the place we go to for Happy hour. If I were rating this on the happy hour alone I would give it two stars. The happy hour really doesn't include any finger food items. The drinks are hardly discounted and the selections are really minimal.  Even with the limited alternatives I wouldn't come here for happy hour. Brunch/lunch (4 stars): The lunch menu used to be pretty mediocre. They recently upgraded the menu and also increased the price. The food is good though but do expect to pay above 250 hkd/person. The weekend brunch is one of the better choices in the area. You have your choice of sweet and savory dishes with the price range from 125-200 hkd per entree. Although, the chicken and waffles are popular. I didn't like it very much  and wouldn't recommend. I can recommend ordering the steak salad or the wagyu rump steak. The beat salad is also quite good as well as the bolognese pasta."
Mr & Mrs Fox,4,"Great food, I'm sure brunch is killer. Service was a bit slow but it also more or less matches what I've come to expect in Asia now. Drink menu is good, I also had a lovely tea and Salad. Good food and cool, funky decor. Would be great place for a medium group."
Mr & Mrs Fox,5,"We inadvertently landed in the hands of the wonderful staff of this bar after some confusion from our taxi driver. We were fresh off the plane in Hong Kong and lookin for our hotel, lost and tired, and the staff here treated us so exceptionally well, we can't thank them enough! Now, onto the food and drinks! While we worked out our travel woes, the bartenders whipped us up the most delicious drinks! We tried a wonderful Moscow mule, one of the best I've had, served up with delicious bitters, crushed ice, and garnished beautifully. The Kobusu Sour was next, tangy and citrusy, and oh so refreshing. Last, but certainly not least and my personal favorite, we ordered a couple of The Huntman. I'm a lover of whiskey and this drink was sooo tasty, smooth, faintly sweet, and faintly smokey. It was top notch! We also tried a pasta dish with bolognese sauce and a delicious burger specially created by their chef. Despite the accidental nature of our visit, we were beyond happy with our experience and we'd recommend everyone to stop in here for the great service and food/drink!!"
Mr & Mrs Fox,4,"Friday night with the girls - we were ready to get foxy! Venturing out to Quarry Bay is new for us but we were adamant to break out Central Cycle and get out of the box (and into the fox). After a somewhat disastrous uber ride (mainly fuelled by heat rage and pregnancy hormones (my two pals not me!) of trying to actually find the uber) we rolled up to a street that reminded me of being back in London, maybe along Canary Wharf or Friday drinks in Covent Garden. With bars and punters stretched out onto the pavements, twinkle lights above the road and the atmosphere filled with relaxed vibes and noisy chatter, that friYAY feeling was definitely in the air. Walking through the bar area of Mr and Mrs Fox, we were passing business folk who were unwinding after a long week. It's very gweilo friendly, and clear that the banks are being driven out of central and are relocating to Quarry Bay / Tai Koo Shing. The decor is modern with that wooden rustic hipster feel and iron work with pumping music - I was a little worried we'd be straining ourselves over dinner again. We were shown up to the second floor where our table was. What impressed me the most was the size of the restaurant. It looked like it stretched to the third floor too... And it was busy. By the end of our meal, they had turned over the tables around us as least once. The music up here was quieter and we could catch up on goss beautifully. The menu is small, and the waiters advised that some plates were also small. We order some cheese and charcuterie to start. The bread was super tasty, crunchy and served with olive butter (could do with a little more salt). I ordered the grouper as a main. Delicious. Perfectly cooked with a hint of spice that added a layer of heat to the plate without overpowering. We ordered sides of spinach, fingerling potatoes and summer vegetables to share. The summer veg won the game with a hint of sweetness and roasted char. The fingerling potatoes were a bit of a disappointment and more of a diced potatoes salad than anything else. Desserts all also fun to munch. Highly recommend the baked Alaska. It's not only a delight on the taste buds with the peanut / marshmallow / rum combination, but watching it catch fire and dance with blue flames so fun! Our other pudding was not not so much fun. Featuring a pea sorbet that tasted like ice mushy peas was not my favourite - though it did bring out a fantastic line from a pal ... ""I kinda like the pea-ness"" (say it out loud and get your mind in the gutter). A nod must be given to the most fun prosecco glasses available. I felt so 1950s glamour supping babycham all night. The glass ware wins a star on its own!"
Mr & Mrs Fox,1,my mains' fish was raw ! That pretty much sums up my experience at Mr and Ms Fox . No matter how interesting the atmosphere and entree were . You should never serve raw!!
Mr & Mrs Fox,4,"We arrived at noon for brunch. It was still pretty empty then on a Saturday, but it was quickly busy by the time we were finishing up.Brunch set (2 course) was $160 and didn't include drinks. Some items are additionally charged, such as the truffle scrambled eggs a with toast.I really liked how the courses were arranged. The starters were mostly healthy cold options like homemade yogurt, muesli, oatmeal or fruit. The main courses were anything from salads to eggs to burger and pasta! It's a brunch menu that's easy to please everyone.I had the muesli and quiche with rocket salad, and my companion had the homemade yogurt and truffle eggs. Quiche was soooooo cheesy! And rhetoric truffle eggs so flavorful! Homemade yogurt was very creamy with the right crunch of granola on top! I had the blood orange lemonade which looked amazing but wasn't something I'd write home about.Overall great experience, love the decor. They were a bit short staffed a bit later in our session but no big complaints there. Only I thought that it came out to be a bit on the more expensive side considering the portions and what was offered. It was good but not like WOW! I NEED TO COME HERE AGAIN. That being said if I ever needed a nice brunch place and didn't want to travel far, I'd come here again as I live only a walking distance away."
Mr & Mrs Fox,4,This was recommend to me by a food blogger I know whilst I was visiting Hong Kong on business.  As I was staying 5 mins away I thought I'd visit for dinner.Went on a Tuesday night around 9pm.  Had a nice buzz and atmosphere about it but wasn't too loud or busy.  As I wanted something to eat they quickly got me seated in a upstairs table.Ordered a pint and then the rib eye with mashed potato.  Beer was good and the food was quick and tasty.  Nice touch by the waiter gifting the beer to me as it turns out I now live in his hometown in the U.K.!Not too pricey.  Would go back when next in HK.
Mr & Mrs Fox,4,"I came here over the holidays to check out the area with a friend.  We stopped into Mr & Mrs Fox for a drink in the happy hour time frame.  Mulled wine was our drink of choice!  I kind of like they even had mulled wine as an option.  It was brewed up that day and full of spices and Christmas cheer!Mr & Mrs Fox is a large, welcoming, modern space with a friendly staff and a welcoming warm wood feel.  Clearly popular on the hip Tong Chong Street, this spot is probably one of the best spots in that area based on design and look alone.  Lots of outdoor seating that is more geared toward the drinking crowd versus the dinner crowd.  Although we only had drinks, I would go back for a meal...because the mulled wine was that good!"
Mr & Mrs Fox,4,"I've been here a couple of times and although it's a little pricy, the food is pretty good and the interior of the restaurant is very vintage and chill! The upstairs I believe is reservation only and has more of a fine dining type menu. The downstairs is for casual lunch/ dinner with tapas and other small plates. I've gotten the burger a couple of times which is a pretty filling meal for the price! The seasoned fries are delicious as well! The aged steak here is also pretty good! Usually for lunch they have a set menu where you and mix and match a starter and a main. They also have outside seating as well. I've never been here for HH or drinks but I always see plenty of people here enjoying drinks and snacks after work!"
Mr & Mrs Fox,5,"Just got an early taste of Swire's latest gig on a ""multi-level dining experience"".For one thing that Swire always does right, it's the decor and the vibe. And in Mr & Mrs Fox that's excellent. You feel right sitting at any spot of the restaurant. The main bar at the center of the restaurant is very welcoming too. The other thing that earned a star in my mind right away - they haven't had the liquor license yet, so instead of telling the customers ""sorry, but please order one of these mocktails."" like all other restaurants would do, they offered complimentary drinks upon ordering food. Well, certainly, we saw some freeloaders there, but the arrangement actually made us felt very good. They were only serving one red wine (pinot noir, which is my favorite but a lot of people will find it too pale) and one white wine (sauvignon blanc). But you could also pick three different kinds of Young Master ales on tap (hipster alert), or get one of their special cocktails. The food was very good, despite the fact that the choices were very limited. The ground floor is supposed to be the ""bar area"" and the second floor as the proper sit-down restaurant and the third private kitchen (and hence,  ""multi-level dining experience""). So we essentially ordered all most of the menu items here to feed a table of 6.The assorted hams and assorted cheese were very good. You could tell that it's not a ""menu placeholders"", but both carefully selected that ham lovers and cheese lovers would like to see and taste. I liked the deep fried squids and mussels too. Staff were nice and friendly - definitely giving you the Soho/expats vibe, as more and more restaurants in Quarry Bay are doing as well.The two hiccups (few menu items + freeloaders occupying the table) will most likely be resolved by grand opening, and I'd definitely come back again for a proper dining experience."
Mr & Mrs Fox,2,"The restaurant is still in soft launch, so one would expect some rough edges in service and facilities. During this period (until Sept), it is half price, so quite good value. However, the portion is quite small, it would seem to be expensive if at full price. The food quality is quite good though. The lamb sausage was flavourful. The pork bun quite juicy."
Mr & Mrs Fox,4,"This is a nice addition to the Tai Koo Place in the Quarry Bay neighborhood. It opened only last year and become a popular spot in this area.On the ground floor you will find the huge bar area, neatly designed and with nice modern and rustic decor. There's a also a small outside seating area if you prefer. Service is fine as long as it's not packed, it can get slow by then. We came on a weekday at around 7 and the place started filling up. They have a nice drink list including a good variety of beer, good wines by the glass and innovative cocktails. If you want something to nibble to go with your drink try the cold cuts or the Korean style chicken wings. The wings come conveniently boneless and are really tasty!After drinks we headed up to the first floor to be seated for dinner. The main dining room is spacious, service is attentive, friendly and very knowledgeable. They have a decent wine list suiting every budget. The food menu is not huge, with interesting, tasty and innovative dishes. If you like oysters they have a decent selection and they are really very fresh! My favorite appetizer was the hand cut tartar and for main the Tomahawk steak, which is a 42 oz piece of beef cooked to perfection. Leave room for dessert especially for their bomb Alaska and their ice cream / sherbet selection. Mr. and Mrs. Fox is not cheap but good value for money!"
Mr & Mrs Fox,4,"After a few months of silence on Yelp, I am glad to come back with a positive review! I went for dinner with three more to Mr & Mrs Fox last night and I was not disappointed. The expectations were high though. The atmosphere and the deco are great - Mr and Mrs Fox doesn't lack space (being its own landlord helps). It's open, sleek and welcoming. We went straight to Mrs Fox for food (second floor). So now, on to the food - we ordered a few oysters and the Iberico pork collar. As starters, they were good, the oysters not very strong in taste and rather small and the meat was well paired with the other ingredients, although a rather small portion. For mains we ordered the T bone and snapper with two sides, broccoli and fries. It was all gone in a matter of minutes...the T bone is actually not as big as we expected so we went on to order the 16oz bone in streak steak. That was probably the star on the table - the meat so tender and fatty, it was melting in the mouth. I'd normally go for medium rare of medium, but the guys ordered this one rare which turned out to be a oh yes!At that point, I was pretty much full, having indulged myself on the cheesy broccoli side which happened to be in front of me and wow, even though it's a side, it is 'the side' you have to order! Combined with the meat, really great. Two of us ordered dessert, nicely presented but I can't comment as I didn't try. All in all, its a nice place, a little far from our neighbourhood, but surely one we will visit from time to time. I don't think the prices are ridiculous, compared to other places of the like in Hong Kong. For all that we paid around 1500. The staff is helpful and it is a truly nicely done place. Yes, I do recommend!"
Mr & Mrs Fox,3,"Despite sounding more like a Disneyland ride, Mr. and Mrs. Fox delivers a palate changing roller coaster ride. During their soft opening, 50 percent off the entire menu plus free alcohol drink. @professorsavings approved. Known as a one shot wonder, I had a slight splash of gin mixed with some fruity fruity mix. Refreshing my palate, the sea sweet oyster opened my appetite along with plump shrimp with ample roe. The main actor did not disappoint.Soft bun hugged moist beef cooked just right on medium rare. Slight nutty notes from melted cheese finished the perfect bite. Fries were on point but needed a bit of seasoning. Imported premium ketchup makes you do the sweet and tart tango. Hip hop through steel doors and be welcomed by a wooden interior that is inviting, modern, and hip."
Mr & Mrs Fox,4,"Friendly staff, great beer, food and music. The burger was excellent. Good value too."
Mr & Mrs Fox,5,"First impressions: friendly waitstaff, very large space, prices are a bit high for quarry bay, even given the area (right near Newsroom and other restaurants).Good environment.  Waiter was transparent about the fact that some of the portion sizes are not very large.Good lighting due to all of the windows.  Next time I will go to the second floor for the view, though not expecting a tremendous view since it's across from tall office buildings.Good interior design.  Everything looks new.I'll walk you through my experience (in case you're interested, if not feel free to skip to my one line summary below)Ordered a latte and it came in a glass mug - I'm not especially fond of these glass mugs, since whatever's inside always seems to cool down much faster than ceramic mugs.  However, the latte itself was good.  Flavor is great - temperature could be a bit warmer.  They give you individually packaged sugar cubes.. sanitary, but not entirely environmentally friendly.  I'd personally prefer just a tub full of sugar, but I'm nit-picking.Place is filling up, though there are still a few tables left on ground floor and it is prime lunch/brunch hour.  In their defense, they just opened.  During the working week, I'd expect this place to be packed since it's so close to Swire's offices.Ordered the pressed reuben sandwich.  This was VERY good.  Just the right amount of spice, oil, salt, corned beef and cheese (gruyere).  AND, it was served on a beautiful piece of marbled wood - they were either really trying to impress me (I'm a woodblock printmaker-someone who appreciates this sort of thing) or they got lucky ;).  Either way, it definitely added to the experience.I don't usually give out 5 stars, but this deserves an exception.Pros:Great lighting, friendly staff, great decor (esp. the wood my food was served on) and an outSTANDing reuben sandwich.  I'll be coming back with friends.Cons:A bit pricey for Quarry Bay, but great when you're trying to impress someone :)"
Shugetsu,5,"I went to Shugetsu when I was on vacation in Hong Kong. Their Michelin guide rating was totally earned! Everything came out in a timely fashion and the portions were relatively large. Their pork was different in that it was grilled, but it was still good!"
Shugetsu,4,"We were in the north point area looking for something a bit different. Shugetsu didn't disappoint us. The food was great! The space is a bit tight, as all seats are at the bar, and seemed to fill up quickly after we arrived."
Shugetsu,5,"This place is Michelin recommended for a reason. Never disappoints because:-amazing food- I usually get the original with 300mg worth of noodles and extra cha siu-fast and excellent service-cozy and small-accepts Octopus card-very affordable for a restaurant in Soho/centralThe dipping broth is just impeccable. They give you choices of hot/cold noodles, and 100/200/300mg worth of noodles (all the same price!), options for extra ingredients. The seating could be a little awkward if you're going with a big group of people, as the seats are in a row (ramen bar style-sort of)But it's nevertheless a great, budget-friendly dining experience"
Shugetsu,5,"good just like the one in central, and the main solid lunch spot for around taikoo place.  ordered some dumplings with the tsukemen (standard 200g, signature tangy savory dipping sauce), but these were on the sweet side and needed more soy vinegar."
Shugetsu,4,"Not many eateries open on weekends, and therefore not many good choices if you want to eat out around Taikoo Place the office area on weekends. Luckily this ramen place was open when we were wandering for food last week. We always go to the one at Central / Sheung Wan, and it has been one of our all-time-favourite ramen places. We have ordered the signature tsukemen and the ""shrimp oil mixed noodle"". Both of them were very yummy. They were able to keep the same standard as the Central shop. The noodle is chewy and the soup is thick, while the mixed noodle is oily and fatty (I like it:P). Will definitely come more often."
金峰靚靚粥麵,5,"So happy that this is the first and last meal of my short stay in Hong kong. I have to say , this is one of my flavourite porridge/ congee place in Hong kong. Being the fact that it is only 5 min walk from my mom's flat. It is definetly much better than the 1 michellin star congee place Ho Hung Kee to me. I felt like the original small local food boutique are getting harder and harder to find. This is a great local store. How do you know is local? There is no English menu. My absolute flavourite is the pork blood dried scallop congee. Coming from the US, nothing come close to the pork blood in Hong kong. Slightly tender skin with soft, melting inside, moist and jello. I know it might sounds gross, but it's an acquired taste. Sometimes I get their fish fillet congee, it is made from fresh fish fillet , not the frozen ones from the state, so there is going to have small fish bone. It's as fresh as you can get.I also enjoy their rice paper rolls ( cheung fun) , but i would most like to order it only if i dine in. The sauces that they let you take home with just doesn't taste the same. The peanut sauce and the sweet sauce. It's much better if you eat there.Another thing you should know is, avoid going early in the morning before work hours and lunch, oh and weekend. There will be lines for both dine in and togo. So plan accordingly."
金峰靚靚粥麵,4,"Quick and simple meal for one or five. This place is small so expect to share your table with someone else. No English language menu here so strictly for patrons who understand the local language. Three main dishes here- congee with variety of protein, rice noodle with a variety of protein and simple soy fried noodle. They don't mean to be rude but most people who come here know what they want so the wait staff will hover over you expecting you to spew your order. Your order comes out quickly so turnover is fast and cash only.We ate two different variety of rice noodles wrapped in dried shrimps and fried dough. Drank hot HK coffee and iced milk tea. Very satisfying."
金峰靚靚粥麵,5,"This little mom and pop restaurant has the best traditional Cantonese congee (粥), plain rice noodles (齋腸粉), and doughstick rice noodles (炸兩). To quote Goldilocks, ""the congee is just right,"" not too watery and not too thick. The rice noodles are smooth, and the doughstick rice noodles are crunchy and not oily. During a one month visit to Hong Kong, I've gone there for breakfast at least 10 times. The place is a little small, only 4 tables that fit around 5 people. However, the turnaround time is pretty fast. I usually visit some time between 9:30am-11am and have never waited more than 15-20 mins."
金峰靚靚粥麵,5,Great food. Fast service. I suggest you take a look at the menu before your number is call and get seated. Lady at front door is very nice and has great crowd control skill!
金峰靚靚粥麵,4,"I LOVE steamed rice roll to the point that I can eat that everyday for breakfast. Trust me in Toronto, it is not easy to find well made steamed rice roll.I LOVE pig blood congee! (I probably should not be eating that everyday)Trust me in Toronto, it is IMPOSSIBLE to find a bowl of well made pig blood congee.The line up at 金峰靚靚粥麵 was manageable on a Saturday morning. And to think the takeout line was twice as long?! I can assure you that it worth the wait!Steamed Rice Roll with green onion and dried shrimpSteamed Rice Roll with beefAnd of Course Pig Blood Congee (the aroma of rice and the perfect texture of pig blood cube!)Now this is the rice roll I have been dreaming about since I came back to Toronto. They are that good!The restaurant itself is small and crowded. Expect to share tables. The lady that runs the restaurant is efficient, friendly and no nonsense. It is just so much fun watching her shouting out orders and making sure everything and everyone are in their right places."
Public,4,"The public food court is located on the 37th floor in the one island east building. I come here on rainy days and when I want a snack. My review is based on the following:Food: 3 starsView: 5 starsConvenience and variety: 4 starsRecommendations: Bombay fish curryThey have a wide variety of offerings. There is a table service restaurant, coffee bar with salads and quick bites, pasta bar, meat carving station,  Indian, and pan Asian food. I typically will take a look around and end up ordering something from the Indian stand. Both the chicken tikka and Bombay fish curry are good. The portions are quite generous so you will definitely not be hungry afterwards. You have a choice of either rice or naan. The naan isn't the best and I would recommend going with the rice.I have had the meat carving station a few times and don't find it to be very good. It looks better than it tastes similarly to when you go to the carving station at the buffet. The view here is really awesome. You get a panoramic view of the Victoria harbor and the neighboring mountains. Definitely would recommend to come by for a quick meal and to enjoy the view."
Public,4,"Although Public may seem like one of those office building restaurants that you go to just because that's the only choice, I find that Public's food quality is actually rather high. It wouldn't say it's the most affordable thing to eat, but it's definitely a step up from your run-of-the-mill Hong Kong style cafe in the Quarry Bay area. I also appreciate that they have seasonal food. For example, because we are in the holiday season they actually serve turkey.Normally I just grab and go from Public, but this time around I actually sat down to eat. I ordered their sous vide turkey breast with chestnut stuffing. The turkey breast was tender and not dry at all. The little balls of deep fried stuffing were also delicious. One of my friends had the burger, which looked amazing, and my other friend had the lobster linguine, which also looked fantastic. One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the view. It's located on the 37th floor of One Island East so it has an incredible view of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and Victoria Harbour in general.My lunch was $150 and it came with a coffee or tea. I believe an appetizer could be added for about $50. A cool tip about this place is that if you come here after 17:00, all of their grab and go food is 50% off!"
Public,5,"Favorite lunch place when in the area. View is amazing since its on the 37/F, food is amazing quality especially when comparing to stuff around the area because its pretty bad around, and prices are reasonable (55$ for a salad with three choices, and it has meat). My company has an office location here, whenever I'm in the building this is my go-to. Salad is a popular option, but they have a variety of western hot food, an indian food corner, sushi, soup noodles, and chinese bbq. All look great, can only speak towards the salad though. Fresh ingredients, none of the options are too saucy and they have a little zing to them from the lemon they put. Barley and the pasta are my two favorite choices from the salad bar."
Public,4,"Missed Connection on 11th April 2016, 12:15pm:You were wearing a white blouse and black skirt and I was wearing light grey suit and a blue tie with speckles of my hastily consumed cream of mushroom soup ($15), which was a bit heavy on the cream and low on mushrooms.You sat across from me at the family style table because at lunch time, though the seating is ample, the place is an absolute zoo.  Maybe people come for the beautiful views that you get from the 37th floor, or maybe it's just super convenient if you work in One Island East.  I know I go for the same reasons.I saw you looking at my sandwich.  That's OK, it was a really nice sandwich of surprisingly flavorful pate with lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise, all between a pleasantly squishy demi-baguette ($55).  Were you surprised as I was to find such a bold sandwich combination at a rather sterile looking place such as Public?  That's OK, I am always pleasantly surprised by the somewhat unconventional menu at Public.  Yesterday I had the corned beef and emmental mini-baguette ($30) which was surprisingly filling despite its small stature.  I'm afraid the mushroom soup was still pretty weak.You were eating the pick-three salad combo ($55), which is my favorite thing at Public.  Today it was fresh heirloom cherry tomatoes, roasted veg, and penne with peas and pesto.  It was lovely..  I hope you'll agree with me in thinking that Public is one of the best places to lunch in the area.  Signed,Chris H"
Public,4,"Public is a hidden gem in Quarry Bay, nestled in One Island East the business building, you will easily miss out this place, especially there is another one on ground floor and Pacific Coffee just the opposite.  Arrived to the 37th floor with fast speed lift, you feel like you are in Sky100. They are similar with down-to-ground window, comfortable sitting area and stunning views, but you pay like hundred sixty there and none here. Yes, none, basically Public is a cafe and deli, so you are welcome to sit and have your own food, serving youself with view to Victoria Harbor, Lion Rock and Tseung Kwan O.The coffee is not superb, but they have enough to offer includes a good drink list. Try to avoid coming in lunch time, will be packed with all businessmen."
Public,4,"One Island East is a skyscraper in Quarry Bay run by Swire Properties, and in the building are hundreds of hungry office workers. Business-savvy Swire would never miss an opportunity, and so, their concept was born - Public! There are actually 3 Publics in the building, one Public on the ground floor, then Public the restaurant and Public the deli both on 38/F. All of them cater to the lunch crowd. This review is for the Deli on 38/F.The food is actually quite typical, sandwiches, salads and pasta, at decent quality and all in easily take away-able packaging. In addition, they also have hot food counters serving curry, roasted foods and chinese, depending on the menu that day. The price is similar to a Simply Life, which is slightly below the $100 mark.  Affordable and extremely convenient for people who work inside the building.  Public closes at 6pm, so is obviously a lunch-only place, they do not aim to be the next Michelin restaurant, but the concept is clear: a good place to have a lunch BREAK: The area is spacious, seats are self serve and almost every seat gives you a sweeping view of the lush green hills behind Quarry Bay or a panorama of Victoria Harbor. You will get a true sense of the word ""break"" here. Besides that, there is also a foosball table, which I presume is a well-appreciated installation, from the giggling office ladies playing with it, and for the really nervous people, there is a gigantic stock ticker and news display rolling across the top of the entire deli.Overall, a decent place to buy takeaway or to chill during lunch. But be mindful of being overheard - remember that the restaurant almost exclusively serves people working in One Island East - today I bumped into my company Chairman grabbing a salad here!"
Public,4,"Public is a great place to come and take your lunch break! Although be warned, if you come during peak hours you might not find a seat! Public serves a variety of food and they have different menu items each day. It's kinda like a cafeteria style place where you can choose your meal. It reminds me a lot of Whole Foods and their food is pretty decent! I love the Indian curry here! The chicken tikka and tandoori are pretty good and they do a pretty good veggie korma as well. I've also had the lamb roast before which is pretty good! They also have a sushi/ udon section as well as an Italian section which I have yet to try! If you get a drink with your meal it usually costs about 100hkd. Overall a great casual place to come eat if you are too lazy to walk outside of your office building!"
Public,3,"Went for brekkie before work, nice view, chic and atmosphere.  Not much variety in my opinion given it only does brekkie and lunch.  The food is actually not bad but then nothing special, when comparing to Sydney standards, a 3 star (which is how I do my rating) but if compare to other HK restaurants, a 4star seems fair."
Plat du Jour,5,"A two course French dinner for under HKD200 a head? Impossiblé you say? Mai oui says I.Plat du Jour is a friendly French restaurant in Island East, very handily located close to One Island East, Oxford House and the rest of the Tai Koo Place complex. It's the ideal spot for a quick classy business lunch, but, this time, I went for dinner. Apparently it's the first stand-alone restaurant owned by Swire properties, so it makes sense that it caters for a massive Swire complex full of bankers and consultants. You'd think that with this sort of target market the prices would be a tad inflated, but, this is post GFC (apparently) and I guess the theory is that these hard-nosed types aren't going to stand for ballooning client entertainment costs. I'm not complaining.You've got all the white linen and candle lit ambiance of an expensive (and dare I say it - snooty) French restaurant without the equally snooty price tag, and the food at PdJ is still great.They do an express lunch service - handy for those billing by the hour, but I'm talking dinner here. The evening menu features some very tasty looking starters, mains and desserts - which will set you each back HKD185 for two courses or HKD225 for three.I went with the slow cooked pork chop with celeriac and green apple remoulade and toasted walnuts and creme brûlée with berry compote dessert - it was yummy! But I think I'll try the light chocolate mousse next time, variety - spice of life and all that."
Plat du Jour,4,"Plat du Jour serves classic French bistro fare at a mid-range price point. Two course meal is 230-350 hkd and three course is 270-400 depending on what you order. I came here for lunch and had the three course set and my rating is based on:Food: 4.25 starsService/environment: 3.5 starsValue: 4 starsOverall: 4 starsRecommendations: the French chicken, chocolate fondant I had the smoked salmon as my first course. Not especially exciting dish but done pretty well. The salmon is served on a piece of toasted bread and topped with greens. The greens were a bit too much and could have used a bit more salt. Overall still pretty tasty. The French chicken dish is a signature dish and I can see why. You get too pieces of chicken served over mashed potatoes with asparagus.  This dish is really delicious. I will come back here just to order this. Chicken is really tender and juicy and the asparagus is cooked perfectly as well. For dessert I had the apple tart. This is ok and wouldn't really recommend. Not bad per se but wasn't great. The ice cream was the best part of the dish."
Plat du Jour,4,"Tucked down a tightly packed New York looking road, this is a cozy little French Bistro that made me think I was back in West Village for dinner instead of Quarry Bay. Came with a group, and shared as is the Hong Kong way. Really loved the enormous red cheese slicer that was used to shave our Grana Padano on the charcuterie platter, the stand outs of the evening were the gravadlax-- lovely and smoky served simply with a bit of creme fraîche and toasted baguette as well as the most wonderfully cooked lamb chops that were perfectly seasoned. Other than the mutton at Bowrington Road's Hot Food Centre this is probably the best lamb dish I've had in HK thus far. Full bar was there, but I only had wine. To roundup: Great concept, awesome service and decent pricing scheme. I'm a fan!"
Plat du Jour,4,"Excellent food and good service. Don't like the location being in Pacific Place, but depending where you sit, it's okay."
Plat du Jour,3,"I went here for lunch, at a price range of around $200 for lunch I would expect a proper bread for starter but it quality is quite disappointing. I have ordered Tuna nocoise salad and their daily special Grilled swordfish. For the salad, their presentation is average. Taste of tuna and salad dressing are blanded. I have also had a zip of their lobster bisque which is way better than their salad, smooth and flavorful.Grilled swordfish is a disappointment, its way overcooked which made it ""FLAKY"" and dried. The goodside is they used tomato sauce sautée zucchini and squash which is very good but it doesnt go well with this particular fish. I rather they have a sauce and a creamy potato puree or some sort. I had a bit of their pork chop from my friend, they used quality pork chop and cooked it to medium well done, its still juicy so I guess I have ordered the wrong dish."
Plat du Jour,5,"Best meal I have had in 4 days in HK by far. The beef was excellent, everything was fresh  and well prepared, the desert was fantastic. If I were staying here any longer I'd eat here every night."
Plat du Jour,5,Exceptionally good bistro food. The best I've had in Hong Kong.  An exceptional value as well. Highly recommended.
Formosa Autumn,5,"Friend recommended this place. Seriously, was really good.Food: I had the minced meat and soy sauce egg with rice. It comes with a cold appetizer of garlic-seasoned cucumbers and carrots. The set also comes with a cold soy milk. You may change to a different drink for an additional charge. The flavor was all really good, and portion size was perfect for me. Soy milk was good too. No grainy bits and not too sweet.Service: They were very efficient in taking our order. Food came quickly. Good for a quick lunch.Price: HK$50+Tip: Go before 12pm as the place starts to get packed. We were first ones there on a weekday at 11:45am."
Formosa Autumn,3,"I had very high expectations, seeing all the positive 5-star reviews. Very tight and intimate restaurant setting. They don't give you much room between tables. We ordered two beef noodles, one with soup and one without (HK$65 each). The beef soup noodles had a very flavorful and strong broth, a bit sweet for my taste. The dry one was ok, not too memorable. I ordered Taiwanese fried chicken expecting the crunchy and crispy popcorn chicken bites, but they were chicken strips instead? Not the same... Our friends also ordered fried shrimp with salted egg sauces and it ended up costing HK$118?! A rip-off, much? Drinks service was a bit slow, while they served my friend's beer right away, they overlooked my cold soy milk, which was given to me in a takeaway cup with straw...? The 乾煸四季豆 green beans was pretty tasty, lots of the fried dried shrimp. I'll return if I'm in the Quarry Bay area and craving Taiwanese beef noodles."
Formosa Autumn,5,"The most traditional taste of Taiwanese Beef Noodle!Originally I just think it tasted good, so I brought my Taiwanese boss there. And unexpectedly he was deeply in love as he said the soup ingredient is exactly the same as the one in his own Taiwan origin! (He told me the trick is on the sweet pickle, their secret recipe haha...)So if you ever come by, order one, sip and taste the soup really.. really.. slowly. I promise the taste would be unforgettable!!!!!PS. Please do not mind it is a bit crowded as it is just a small local business, please do not expect service here :) And don't be scared by the restaurant boss haha! She looks and talks strictly but she is in fact really nice! Ask her about Taiwan and she will tell you her stories! Yeah!"
Formosa Autumn,5,Have tried at least a dozen of their dishes and none so far has disappointed. And I'm half-Taiwanese. Street parking right outside.
Nha Trang,4,"No frills Vietnamese restaurant that serves a variety of types of Vietnamese cuisine from regions across the country. Food here is good and is a good place for a quick meal. Will get really crowded during lunch time (weekend or week day) and I would expect to wait for a table if you come after 12:30pm.  They do offer delivery through Deliveroo but there is a 15-20% markup from the price in the restaurant. Food: 4 starsService/environment: 3.5 starsValue: 4 starsOverall: 4 starsRecommendations: pork chop over broken rice, fried spring roll, beef banh mi, fish cakes, Vietnamese coffeeMy favorite thing to order here is the porkchop rice. The porkchop is cooked with lemongrass and served over coconut rice. It is also paired with a cold egg omelette. Really delicious and fillingThe spring rolls here are also good and is one of my barometers for a quality Vietnamese place. The pho and Bo bun hue are pretty good but not great and I don't think the soup noodles are the highlights of this place.  The banh mi here however is quite good and you won't go wrong with either the pork or beef versions. They don't serve a classic pate banh mi which is a bit disappointing."
Nha Trang,2,"Was staying at The East for work and this was a convenient place to stop by before heading back.  I was looking forward to having some pho but was underwhelmed by what I was served.  Ordered the Pho Tai but found the soup to be bland and the rice noodles to be different.  They did have a pretty extensive menu though, so maybe their other dishes are better, but unfortunately, the pho was definitely not at all to par."
Nha Trang,4,"The food is quite solid. A friend brought me here and for the next two weeks all I wanted to eat was Nha Trang for any reason for any meal. In the end, I probably had it 3 times in 2 weeks. The dishes are quite good. My favorite is the beef wrapped in a leaf. The beef flavor was very strong and it was well-seasoned. Their bun rieu (crab noodle) was quite good as well.As the place gets quite busy during lunch, service may be a bit slower and it's best to arrive earlier before the lunch rush. It would be great if their prices were a bit lower then it would be perfect! Otherwise, I quite enjoy their food!"
Nha Trang,4,"A solid 4 stars out of 5! I prefer bep but this comes close. The shaking beef was amazing and the bun xuong nuong. You have to try the Vietnamese iced coffee, it is to die for !!!Overall a great experience and will be coming back for sure."
Nha Trang,4,"Yummm...vietnamese food!Makes my tummy happy anyday.HK generally lacks good vietnamese food.  So, I'm really glad I found this place.I've been here many times and it has not yet dissappointed me.Pho broth is well balanced and veggies are still crispy.There are so many choices on the menu so if you're a newbie with vietnamese food, just go with the basic PHO.  If you're not in the mood for soup, the vermacelli is another option.If you're not feeling the noodles, then try the pork and rice crepe with pork and veggies! Yum!10% service chargeCredit Cards accepted if your bill is over 200$. So bring some cash."
Nha Trang,4,"I didn't think there were any good Vietnamese restaurants in Hong Kong until I found Nha Trang! The Bun rieu, pho ga, and pho tai were all really tasty. Around HKD65 for a bowl of pho. Starters start around HKD60. So almost just better to get another main. Will definitely come back to try the bun bo hue. Great coffee too. Clean and very nice inside!"
Nha Trang,5,"Love this place! Great service, food, and ambience. I went to the location near Tai Koo. Kid friendly."
Wah Cheong Congee & Noodle Shop,4,"Love this place!Especially love their roast duck lo mee (燒鴨撈麵) and congees (及第)! Authentic, clean, top notch quality food! Their steam veg (油菜) is great too!I guess my only complaint would be that they can get way too busy and kinda hurry you out during peak business lunch hours."
Wah Cheong Congee & Noodle Shop,3,I was jet lag and hungry at 6 am. Wah Cheong is conveniently located across from my hotel and I ended up coming here to enjoy my favourite breakfast: Steamed Rice Roll and Congee.The portion is big for a breakfast set $36. I had better rice roll else where but the one that served here was quite satisfying. There are also Hong Kong Western Style Breakfast to choose from. Breakfast serves from 7 am to 11 pm. Great option if you are in the neighbourhood but does not worth a special trip to come here.
Wah Cheong Congee & Noodle Shop,3,"Diarrhoea for 2 days, tonight we want to eat congee. We order two pork meat ball congee, one rice dumpling and one steamed rice-flour roll. The fried dough stick is crispy but the rice-flour roll is too thick. The congee is not tasty."
Wah Cheong Congee & Noodle Shop,5,"24 kinds of congee on the menu at last count. That's what you need to know. The roast meats are good, the Cheung fun is good, but the congee, that's why you come here. And the Shredded Roast Duck Congee (火鴨絲粥), OMG. One of the reasons to come to this neighborhood. If you don't do the congee on a weekend morning, there is no point."
Wah Cheong Congee & Noodle Shop,4,"This is a pretty local restaurant serving Cantonese food staffed by old Chinese dudes, don't look around the restaurant too much or you'll lose your appetite, as it's pretty run down and the floor is never clean. One thing they do really well is the bbq pork and roast duck, it's much better than Tai Hing's, the other dishes are hit and miss, I mostly just come here for the BBQ pork and steamed fish."
Wah Cheong Congee & Noodle Shop,4,"So glad I stumbled upon this congee shop while I was walking around Taikoo. The highlight for me was the breakfast special, you get a bowl of congee and a side dish for a very reasonable price. One warning, the congee is very, very hot. Perhaps that's the way it's supposed to be, but I suggest letting your bowl chill for a sec, or that you blow on your dollop of rice porridge goodness. Having been four times for different meals, this place never gets too packed, service is quick and impersonal and seating is plentiful. The pork skin congee in particular truly hits the spot. While I would say that pricing during non-breakfast hours is a little excessive, it's still affordable. There's twenty four options for congee on the menu, the decor itself is no-frills, but if you're seeking this comfort food staple and you're hankering for unoffensive Cantonese, then look no further than this kewpie noodle shop. Standby."
Simplylife,5,"A great find for American restaurant!  Not quite sure if it's American or not, but great Western food for someone comes from the states ;) Good ambience, and great food and dessert. A cute, quaint little corner in the city plaza with lots of greens outside of the restaurant. I went on a sunday afternoon, seems to be a busy time where everyone is out for brunch. The wait is about 15 to 20 min for a table for 3. But you can grab your ticket at the automatic ticketing and leave your phone number with them, and head out to walk around the mail. They will give you an auto call to let you know your seats will be ready at 3 tables wait, which I found it pretty awesome and efficient, rather then just purely waiting and waste time. Food is great, had their mushroom soup and cucumber salad, chanterelle and spinach pizza and fish fillet with ink bun burger. Oh and their blueberry cheese cake and matcha cake. They are all great, minus the fries. Portion are generous, and the salad and soup are gourmet and not just slap on veggie or soup from cans. Mushroom soups are from mushroom puree and the cucumber salad are dressing with citrus dressing that are quite refreshing! I like their attention to detail on even just appetizers and drinks ( iced tea) , are well prepared.Must return for another meal soon!"
Simplylife,4,"Simply life has a great lunch set menu, which during weekdays really draws a large crowd. The lunch set gives a choice of soup or salad, choice of entree and comes with a drink. My rating is based on the following:Food: 4 stars Atmosphere: 3.5 stars Value: 5 stars for the lunch setThe ice tea here is fantastic and will always order that with my lunch. It isn't too sweet and has hint of orange flavor to it.  The salad on the other hand I would skip. The salad isn't dressed very well and the dressing is too sweet for my taste. The soup is a much better option. The bread that it is paired with is perfect for dipping in the soup.I haven't tried all the mains but the ones that I have tried are all quite good. The real standout is the truffle and mushroom pasta. I'm a huge black truffle fan and the flavor of the truffle really comes through. Given the price of the lunch set this is a really good deal. The hamburger is also good and so is the duck."
Simplylife,3,"I went here for brunch today at around 1pm (Sunday) They've moved their old location in Citiplaza to a bigger venue, it was always quite busy and today I finally went to find out what the hype is all about! OK, first of all, the decor, even from the outside was quite impressive. It features a lot of greenery and wooden furnishing and low ambient light so it's got a good vibe. Inside though, I thought it was a bit less impressive.The wait was ONE hour! It's an automated ticketing system and you can leave your number with them and they will notify you when it's 3 tables before your number, so you can feel free to walk around vs. wasting time standing. Weird thing was that even after we got the ticket notification for 3 tables,  we actually had to wait about 10 more tables and 20 mins more before being seated. Luckily I had good company queuing with me so it didn't feel that long. I would've never waited past 30 mins otherwise.The brunch menu had quite an extensive number of options, and they call come with iced tea/ soft drink and soup/ salad. I chose the iced tea and salad: the iced tea is pretty impressively tasty with slices of orange in it - very refreshing and a seemingly ""healthy"" touch. The salad was small and came with bread. I enjoyed the salad quite a lot, fresh and crunchy greens with a light favourful dressing mixed in already. Well balanced.For the main, I ordered the smoked salmon bagel. I was disappointed with this one. I expected meaty, fleshy smoked salmon atop a chewy bagel and got none of it. It was more like an scrambled egg made with tiny bits of smoked salmon, on top of a bagel. The bagel wasn't chewy at all, it just tasted like toasted white bread, the scrambled egg itself tasted pretty ordinary, nothing to write home about. The dish did come with toasted tomatoes topped with goats cheese - delish. I wish they made the ice tea refillable.Overall not too impressed with the offerings, but perhaps the other dishes would be better."
Simplylife,5,"This is the place can chill with friends in the afternoon or great place for Sunday brunch. Nice decoration with flowers n greens, open kichen area is clean. Really luv the Mushroom soup and the ice tea. This is a must return restaurant."
Simplylife,5,"Afternoon Tea is a good reason to add one more meal to the usual routine of Breakfast-Lunch-Dinner. The afternoon tea menu is a prix fixe including a choice of beverage (homemade iced tea, soft drink, coffee or tea), and a choice of (burger, ciabatta, bread, quesadilla, handmade cake), served with spicy fries (except when ordering the cake). I ordered a Farmer's Bread with mushroom, spinach, gouda cheese, pesto. Thanks to the neighbors tables, I learned that here, people eat bread with a fork and knife. It would have been rude if I started eating with my fingers. :P However, I was fighting with the bread crust, because they don't give you a bread knife! It doesn't slice well, and I had to be careful for it not to fly away to the neighbors. Their baked good looks yummy."
Tenren’s Tea,5,"Inside of Eslite in City Plaza. I usually don't drink Ten Ren in America, but the stores in Hong Kong always have such a long line! My friend's dad once told me that if you see a long line of Asians, it indicates two things: 1) food is good 2) food is inexpensive. Ten Ren is definitely both good and inexpensive. Drinks run to about $13-28. I ordered the green tea with honey. A very simple drink, but it was very good. Sometimes, although you order a honey drink, they just add sugar. Not at Ten Ren! I saw with my own eyes the barista add a generous dosage of honey into my drink. He then mixed it well, added ice, and then put it in the blender for a few seconds.The drink had a very strong tea aroma. You could also taste the honey well. Even when the ice melted a little, the tea flavor was still very good! Great place for any sort of tea. On display are many different types of teas that you can also buy to take home."
Tenren’s Tea,5,"Woohoo! Everybody should know that there is a new cha FOR TEA opened together with the new Eslite Spectrum store. It is now very close to my neighbourhood and I would definitely come more often. Apart from my favourite bubble tea as well as Taiwanese drinks, this shop is also serving tea egg (Did I missed tea egg from other stores? I have never saw any) and ice cream. The other shop that serves ice cream would be the one in Ma On Shan. They got two flavours, green tea and oolong tea, for us to choose from. If you have never tried their ice cream, I highly recommend the oolong tea ice cream. It tastes really special, literally like iced oolong tea! You need to try it!P.S. The queue is much shorter here."
Tenren’s Tea,5,"Out of most of the bubble tea places, this is one of those uses real tea. Yes, the fact is a lot of them do not - they use artificial tea, artificial milk and artificial flavours. Tenren's Tea is one of those that make real green tea out of tea leaves, so it's safe and much more tasty. I've tried the  tieguanyin ice cream last week, which are reallly good - very rich in flavour and quite smooth. Recommended to try this out."
Tenren’s Tea,4,Gotta try the oolong milk tea with tapioca. It's pretty darn good if you are looking for something different to try vs black or green tea.
Beijing City,5,"Brought here on recommendation of a friend and it was a great choice!Food:-Lamb and green onion soup noodles - It was quite unique as I've never had it this way before. It seemed like they cooked a lamb dish and put it in soup noodles and added green onions. The sauce flavor and seasoning was very good, and the soup had a nice, rich flavor.-Watercress and pork dumplings - The dumplings were really good. The ingredients tasted very fresh and it was well-seasoned.Service:They were efficient and pleasant and the food didn't take too long to come. They were friendly too.The dishes were in the $40+ range.I would return!"
Beijing City,3,Restaurants are all packed in this area during lunchtime. I felt like dumplings so decided to give this place a try. I had the pork and cilantro dumplings. The soup is was presented in was a bit salty and after my meal I felt like I needed a drink of water. The dumplings themselves were quite tasty. The dumpling wrapper was nice and thin and had a smooth texture. Ratio of meat to wrapper was also ideal.  The price for 10 dumplings is 50hkd which is about right but slightly on the high side for a place like this. This place is a typical local restaurant where you will need to share your table with other diners. It is pretty small so they need to maximize space. In other wards I wouldn't come here if you want to have a conversation with someone while having your meal.This a good place if you want takeout as the food is prepared really quickly and is not very expensive
Victoria Harbour Supreme,4,"The crab here was so good. It had a lot of meat too. Depending on the weight, you can get a huge one or a smaller one but they are still big. Service here was good. They would pass around to pick up the trash like bones, etc. So you have a clean plate. The view here is pretty nice. You can see all the buildings outside. It is even better at night. If you see around 8pm, you might be able to see the light show that come from the buildings.The restaurant is pretty big and pretty clean."
Victoria Harbour Supreme,4,"This restaurant is located inside a very busy shopping center with fierce competition from other eateries in Taikoo Shing. It offers both regular hour and off-peak hour dim sum price list. The dim sum menu has impressive varieties pleasing different taste buds. We showed up at 11 am and were seated immediately. By noon, it was full with lunch crowd. We ordered traditional items: BBQPork buns, rice rolls, shrimp dumplings, turnip cakes, minced beef balls, steamed rice with beef and fried eggs, sweet and sour pork dish, etc. But a few dishes were refreshingly cute and tasty with romantic names: shrimp and minced pork siu-Mai topped with (mini) abalone (鮑魚燒賣皇), charcoal buns with (mouth watering) lava custard (黑金流沙包), deep fried Canton carp ball with (ample) almond served with clam dipping sauce (金杏蜆芥鯪魚球), pork knuckles and ginger stew (just the right sweetness and sour from mom's cooking) (老媽子豬腳薑), long garlic and shrimp spring rolls (with beautiful display) (蒜蓉蝦長春卷), crispy rice with crab meat and assorted seafood in soup (the right combination bringing out the aroma and taste of seafood) (脆米蟹肉海皇泡飯), steamed pork dumplings with black truffle sauce (黑松露小籠包), and egg pastry (蛋散). To top it off, the best for last was the fried noodles with Buddha's delight (羅漢齋炒麵). Noodles were fried crispy on both sides and served with choi sum and mushrooms!Definitely we will return for more surprising non-traditional dishes!"
Victoria Harbour Supreme,3,"Apparently this is a chain of dim sum in Hong Kong. Although the location had a beautiful view and the establishment was well decorated, the food was okay for the price. Everything was quite pricey for the quality of food. My favorite dish was the pork belly with the crunchy top. It was amazingly delicious!! Otherwise, everything was decent. Glad that we tried it but not sure if it's worth returning."
Victoria Harbour Supreme,4,"If you're looking for a higher end dim sum place with some unique dishes and a killer view (when it's not foggy/humid/rainy, etc), Victoria Harbour Supreme is your place. If you're looking for a place with a dish that will blow your mind and blow your pant buttons off, then Victoria Harbour Supreme is also your place. That dish: Chinese BBQ Pork Belly. Like many other higher end dim sum places, Victoria Harbour Supreme believes that putting a unique twist on dishes warrants a premium. You have your swallow's nest egg tarts and gold-flake crab dumplings among your usual favourites like shrimp dumplings and siu mai. If you think that's gimmicky, they also serve sashimi here. And Iberico black-fur pig. Why? I don't know. I've only come here for lunchtime dim sum (cheaper after 1:30 pm, but not feasible for us working folk). The food tastes alright, fairly average in my opinion, with nothing that blows my socks off. EXCEPT that Chinese BBQ pork belly. Basically they take the concept of Chinese BBQ pork, or cha siu, and apply it to the pork belly instead of the usual lean meat. The result is magical. The glazed edges are crispy and the fat melts in your mouth. This is probably the work of the devil because I've never been so tempted by something so bad in my life. Fatty, flavourful, savoury pork that leads me astray from my path of health and fitness. I'll order it again in a heartbeat. The venue is beautiful, with one wall covered in greenery. It's like you're in an indoor garden...but you've got the symphony of loud, overlapping, dim-sum goers' voices surrounding you. Good option for a banquet or a wedding though. It's also about the same temperature as your fridge inside, so bring a sweater. They do have a limited number of shawls upon request. So yeah, Victoria Harbour Supreme's highlights are being beautiful, cold, and a little bit overpriced... like a high-maintenance girlfriend. But just as a high-maintenance girlfriend will keep you coming back for more, that Chinese BBQ pork belly has got me hooked for the long haul. (68/100) - 2017"
Victoria Harbour Supreme,5,"HIGHLY recommend if you're looking for a place to eat seafood during dinner time! A must order item is the king crab. You should make a reservation and preorder the king crab as well. They have some type of hot pot style with seafood but you have to reserve that type of dinner as well since you would be seated at different kinds of tables that would be suitable to have the hot pot on. We didn't know they had this but it looked delicious. We wanted to try their hot pot style dishes but their tables for that section was fully booked. Instead, we just went with the regular dining where they just simply serve us the food. The restaurant was fully packed on a Tuesday night! As for that king crab, it was probably the most delicious crab I have ever eaten. Shortly after you are seated, they will offer you to pick out your crab from their tank and they give you the option to hold the crab and take a photo with it! The seafood in their tanks are very clean and the whole experience of holding the crab was pretty cool. Then, they'll serve you the crab along with any other dishes you've ordered. You could taste the freshness of the live crab and it had soooo much meat within it. In addition, the ooey gooey goodness in the top shell part was SO delicious. Although they are known for their crab, all their other dishes were amazing as well. Some other things we ordered were roasted goose, lobster cheese noodles, abalone, and a few other things. The lobster cheese noodles are something youdefinitely should order . The noodle texture is very good and the cheese compliments the lobster."
Victoria Harbour Supreme,4,This restaurant is beautiful. I came here for dim sum yesterday and the food was delicious. Everything I tried was fresh and not too salty. My favorite was the Shrimp & Minced Pork Siu Mei Topped with Scallop #50. You get three pieces when you place an order. The food comes out quickly and the workers were very attentive. I wouldn't mind coming back here again to try some other dim sum items.
Victoria Harbour Supreme,1,"I would give this restaurant a negative star if yelp allows it.  This rating is not based on the food. Rather, it's based on the customer service.  The waitress and manager did their very best to try to up sell their menu to us. We wanted the set menu, but we were told that it was unavailable and that we had to pay more since the dish that was part of the set menu was unavailable.  Our question was why would you offer a menu on dishes that were no longer available for the rest of the evening.   We did not get a reasonable answer. Only response was a take it or leave it attitude.  Read the menu and know what you will be paying if you intend to dine here."
Victoria Harbour Supreme,3,"Very poor quality of dim sum.  Porridge is pretty much 80 percent water and tons of MSG.   四寶雞扎 contains pork skin, imitated crab meat, a piece of boneless chicken and a piece of not fully cooked taro.   I was so disappointed of the quality of the dim sum.   I have been there two times for dim sum and i would recommend going to the 2/F 玉桃軒 for dim sum instead.   At least that place would spend a little more money in good ingredients.   Needless to say, the service is bad here.On the contrary of breakfast, dinner is much better.   Seafood dishes are good deals and tasty.   The waitress that served us was quite attentive.   My mom said that the night time cook is a different chef.   So i would recommend this place for DINNER Only."
Victoria Harbour Supreme,4,The food was good but overpriced.  The waiter was most helpful in making up a banquet menu.
Victoria Harbour Supreme,3,"It's decent dim sum for the area. If you eat before 11:30 AM, the dim sum is much cheaper during the weekdays."
Victoria Harbour Supreme,1,"If you want seafood poisoning, make sure you come here !!  We had an order of 聖子 and there was sand and dirt inside.  After 12hrs, all our dinner came back out.  After going through 3hrs of non stop puking and diahorrea we went to the emergency room for a visit.  It's a horrible experience."
Victoria Harbour Supreme,1,"I found a fly in my soup, and the waiter said it was a flake from the fish. A flake with six legs and wings? I think not."
Jubal,5,"Have to say one of the best hidden gems that my family and I found on a Friday night. Usually you'll have to make reservations in advance but because it was still Chinese New Year holiday we got it lucky. There's no menu at this place, the head chef/owner Boris, will come and recommend you items that they have for the day. We ordered the foie gras, smoked salmon salad, pumpkin ginger soup and a plate of charcuterie for appetizers (to our surprise were MASSIVE portions). The lamb chop, pork shoulders and fish pasta for the mains. Everything was done superbly and I feel my mouth watering for more! I felt the salmon salad and pork shoulders were the best out of all that we tried!! Don't let the simplicity of the Salmon salad turn you away, chef has a homemade marinade and smokes it to the point where the meat melt in your mouth and the smokey taste just lingers as you digest. It was HEAVENLY!!!Boris is super passionate about his cooking and food, it was a joy to be able to learn his background and where he got his art from!I would definitely recommend this place for special evenings or bringing around guests for entertainment! It's not a big place and it's not cheap either (our whole meal including half bottle of wine cost us almost $HKD2000), but if you're looking for a special place for a treat (hint anniversaries or valentines day), this is definitely the place!"
Jubal,4,"Excellent food, with a huge variety in Western European dishes.This chef/owner is very passionate about what he does, and you can guarantee that if he isn't proud of something, he won't serve it.As someone who has eaten at this place countless times for the past ~10 years, and while the food does take quite a long time, it's worth the wait. His Foie Gras with rice was always superb, I suppose that counts as fusion cuisine, but it's a surprisingly good mix. Seafood is always a very good choice here, fish dishes as smooth and flaky, and the poultry, tender and juicy. Vegetarian dishes are also very flavourful, so there's never a lack of choices.The chef also makes a mean Creme Brûlée, among other desserts (provided you're there for dinner- lunch rush hits them hard)"
Jubal,3,"what may seem like an ordinary cafe restaurant with an extraordinary crowd daily. If you cannot get there by 12:30 on weekdays, you may as well start opening up your Yelp in search of an alternative !!Though out my work days at quarry bay, I have been here twice over 4 years. Yup it's been a while but you can always be guaranteed some form of quality assurance when restaurants stay that long in this commercial district.  Again, food was surprisingly good given its average presentation. I haven't eaten such a nicely pan fried grappa in a while. The home made onion sauce was well balanced with the sweet soya topping and it was definitely a very innovative dish.however, prices are a bit costly for quarry bay district ( ~$90)."
Jubal,5,"Nice little Western cafe in the heart of Quarry Bay, situated right next to Mcdonalds and Grove. I don't come here very often but both times didn't require any reservations during prime lunch hour. Luckily the lack of wait does not correspond to the lack of taste! Their lunch menus are well portioned running around $80-100 and comes with a hot drink. $4 to upgrade to Cold Drinks. $15 for soup of the day and $25 for garden salad.I got the CHICKEN STEAK $84 and a hot coffee. Their chicken steak is juicy and well seasoned with a hint of citrus in the sauce. Comes with zucchini, bok choy, mushrooms, carrots and a side of mashed potatoes. Great value for the quality!***Tips: Lack of wait! Does not take cardFavourites: Yummy juicy chicken! comes with ample veggiesMeh: Cash onlyLast words: No wait and good value"
Jubal,4,"One of my favorite lunch places near the office! The food here is pretty decent and one of the better western restaurants! Not sure about dinner, but they have a pretty set lunch menu. I usually get the chicken steak and salad or the fish w/ mushroom and rice. The chicken is super tender and juicy! And their seasoning is spot on! They also serve pasta and steak which are also pretty good! Price is about 80-100hkd depending on what you order and lunch comes with a drink and they always change extra for cold drinks here which I'm not sure why... But anyhoo, a great lunch place!"
Feast Food by East,4,"I brought a colleague here when she came for business.We had dinner. The decor and ambience is nice, more on the romantic side , definitely relaxing. I saw that the semi-buffet seemed quite popular with the other diners (plates and plates of crab legs!)We just ordered a la carte, each a soup and a main. I had the french onion and she the lobster bisque. Both were meh, I've definitely had better. The lobster bisque was definitely on the watery side, I'm used to mine with a punch more flavor.My main though! I had a rack of lamb (or maybe they called it lamb steak) and it was so well done. Australian lamb was cooked very tender and still juicy, almost medium rare, just the way I like my meats. The sauce it came with ( 2 types) was just enough of a drizzle and a contrast to bring out the flavors of the lamb. I would have this more often if I can!!I though the staff could be more attentive, although I think they looked understaffed. I would come back for the ambiance and to try out other dishes. They have dishes to cover most cuisines to satisfy even bigger groups of people!"
Feast Food by East,4,"Stayed at this hotel and had breakfast at this restaurant. The food is good- you can either do the buffet or order an entree item. The food is good and there is a wide selection, however, very over priced for breakfast food. The coffee was very good though. If you are staying at the hotel it is very convenient but there are other places in the area that are just as good and less expensive."
Feast Food by East,4,Amazing breakfast spread from various parts of the world. Prompt service and superb staff with really good ambience music. Enough for me to wake up early for breakfast.
Feast Food by East,4,"Feast is a bit expensive but really is a great option for a nice drink in Taikoo. Their cocktail and wine list is extensive, but their draft beers are limited to Heineken (not my personal favorite but at least they have something on tap). I can say that my friend was fully satisfied by their wine selection, and he knows what he is drinking. In general it is a good place for a quiet after-work drink if you work in the area. I've been here separately for lunch and had a fantastic (surprisingly so) burger. The service was nicely attentive and didn't let our drinks sit empty for long. It's a place that I return to for a fancier lunch if I'm in the mood and drinks when it works after a day at the office. For drinks inside it suits the plan for a nice quiet conversation and for lunch it's an excellent treat!"
Frites Belgium On Tap,5,This place is a gem. A great traditional pub in the middle of the East side of Hong Kong. This is located in the lobby of an office building and has a great vibe and decor. There is great open seating and the arrangement has a big community feel. The menu is pretty straightforward with a large beer selection and typical pub fare available. Steak and frites were a popular choice as well as the mussels. They have many sauce options and the mussels are all served in steam pots with a side of really srunchu bread. I ordered them house style and they were prepared with cream garlic and chives. The half order was very large and very satisfying. My sister ordered the chicken parm and it was huge! Big enough for two to share certainly. The service here was excellent and I would return!
Frites Belgium On Tap,4,"This place is so crowded with white collars during happy hours on weekdays, while fully of kids running around on weekends. With a playgound and kids trucks, this place is a paradise for kids. Luckiy it's better on a Sunday night tonight, where only a few families were having dinner and around 10 kids running around (still tolerable). The food was suprisingly good. The crab starter was interesting, a bit spicy and very refreshing. We have ordered a ribs stew with truffle mashed potato, which was very yummy. The wife's sausage was good too but we were already stuffed. Satisfying overall."
Frites Belgium On Tap,4,"Frites is a place for Belgium comfort food. It has several outlets in Hong Kong. We have been to the one in Quarry Bay. The menu is standard for all outlets. Even the decor and setting is almost the same. The one in Quarry Bay is located in the Oxford house of Tai Koo place. It's on ground level, next to elevators. Because of the high ceilings the noise level is quite high. Especially on Friday nights after work when everybody's there for the Happy hour it can get very noisy. Setting is simple rustic, mainly dark wood. Staff is efficient and attentive. They have a full bar with an extensive list of all different kinds of Belgium beers, which is incredible. A few beers are on draught. Selection of food is adequate concentrating on simple but good quality comfort food. My favorites include the classic Caesar and the Nicoise salad. Don't miss out on the fresh European mussels, done in different ways. They are accompanied by awesome French fries. They're thick, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Try your frites with their excellent mayonnaise. Go for the schnitzel and classic fish and chips if you're into deep fried food. The schnitzel is tender even it's pork. The batter is thin and very tasty. Portions are generous, good for sharing. Overall good value for money!"
Mian,4,"Mian means noodles in Mandarin Chinese. As the name implies this small shop specializes in noodles. You can substitute rice for noodles, but I wouldn't recommend doing that.The noodles are either served dry(without soup) or with soup.  Given how hot Hong Kong gets I opt for the dry noodles. Similar to a ramen shop, you can choose the protein pairing as well as the type of noodle thickness.  Food: 4 starsValue: 4.5 stars (~70 hkd for lunch)Service: 3 starsRecommendations: braised pork with dry pappardelle noodlesThis is a regular lunch spot for me. Great place to get a quick tasty meal."
Mian,4,"This is my pappardelle dreams come true! Combining my love of pasta with my love of egg noodles, this was perhaps the one greatest fusion dish I've ever imagined. I made my way into Quarry Bay one cool morning. It did take me a good hour to get there, but nevertheless, I stumbled upon some unique stops enroute to Mian.It's nestled on a smaller street, and it's hard to miss, situated next to a coffee shop. The decor is hip and modern, and clean. Although their menu had other noodle items, I knew I had to get the braised brisket with the 'chinese pappardelle' lo mein. It was exactly how I envisioned it to be. The 2cm thick pappardelle made with duck egg had the perfect texture. The al dente texture complimented the sauce well; it was coated with the slighty sweet soy sauce of the beef. I savoured every bite, and wanted more of the noodles. This place is worth the trek, the quality of the noodles and the meat are stand outs, and one can always explore Quarry Bay afterwards."
Mian,5,"I'm usually not a big fan of chicken nor thick flat noodle, but I love it at Mian!  Mian is located right between Quarry Bay and Taikoo. It's located on that small street filled with many other restaurants. It's not the most spacious, so expect to be very close to your neighbors. They have a couple of long tables and some bar seats along the wall.  They are always packed during weekday lunch hours.  But if you visit any other time, you'll easily get a seat. Mians menu looks complicated but it's not.  You grab the menu paper and fill out what main you want then select the type of noodle.  Most noodles are pretty self explanatory, except for ""QQ"" noodle.  This is actually their thick cut ""chewy"" egg noodle; as QQ usually means 'chewy'.  I see this phrase used a lot around Taiwan bubble tea shops, but not so much anywhere else.  Their most popular dish is their Sichuan Chicken.   Their Sichuan sauce has a hint of mala (tongue numbing spice), but not overwhelming.  Their chili sauce and oil is so tasty with the noodles!  Chicken is succulent and very flavorful with bits of chili oil seeped into the crevices.  They bring out their food pretty quick, and lunch sets include your typical Hong Kong cafe drinks.  Tip: to exit the place, hit the bell on the table next to the automatic door"
Treats,5,"Found this place nearby our apartment in Cityplaza.   The place is huge!  It's got all kinds of Cantonese cuisine, Thai place where we ate, and other Western-inspired cuisine.  The Thai place wasn't open till 11am but it was all good because we shopped in Apita downstairs till it opened.  I'm an American and I love good BBQ. I think I've found my new rib joint here!!  Other Thai food was good such as pineapple fried rice for the youngsters, pho which is not Thai but Vietnamese of course.  Will come back for the ribs and copious quantity of Tiger !!"
Treats,4,"It is a food court on the second floor of the Citiplaza, Taikoo Shing. There are different food venues and plenty of tables. It does get very crowded around lunch time and on weekends. Some venues open early for breakfast items and most open at 11 am for the lunch crowd. You order online for dine in or takeout using the machine situated next to each venue and pay for the order using Octopus card, Applepay, or cash at the cashier. You queue to pick up the order at the pickup window. If you don't order drinks, there is a water fountain :)The BBQ venue has a robust menu with roast duck/goose, poached/soya sauce chicken, BBQ pork with/without rice etc. My favorite one is the BBQ pork on rice with an egg (黯然銷魂飯 :) at HK $43 per bowl!  I had tried roast duck, roast duck and goose, poached chicken, 4-item (duck, chicken, BBQ pork, and sausage) on rice. Each comes with choi sum (vegetable). We have yet to try other venues such as the Pasta La Vista, Thai Cook, etc. This is a good place for casual dining with family and/or friends. The pricing is reasonable if you are not looking for fancy dining!"
Treats,4,"Treats is a food court located inside Cityplaza. This is not a normal food court, at least compare to what I have in Toronto. The selection is plentiful! Great if you come alone or with family or friends. There are the popular item: BBQ, Dim Sum, Thai, HK style Cafe, Western cafe and more.I love the idea of doing pop up with different Michelin starred establishment. POPTREATS 米芝蓮限定POP UP STORE: 蛇王芬 x TREATS or introducing MakiXBurrito 快 靚 正 and something different!"
Treats,4,"I was truely exited to see this new food court opened up near work with new variety of food . A first walk inside the food court got me confused. Be careful not to walk into the hidden restaurants which are also located inside the food court . So far I have tried two stalls here and they were both above expectation ! First one I tried was the BBQ pork rice with egg , you'd probably see a lot of locals queuing for this stall and it's because if its name in Cantonese "" 黯然銷魂飯"". This name is literally taken out from one of Stephen Chow's famous movie and for this reason I was also attracted to try .Second time here, I tried the pasta. It was so delicious . the lobster bisque sauce was unforgettable..."
Tai Hing,5,"The food at Tai Hing is just average, but I'm giving this particular branch 5 stars because the service and cleanliness level here is much better than other Tai Hing restaurants, and they have hands down the best Hong Kong milk tea in the neighborhood."
Tai Hing,4,"If you ever visit Hong Kong and wanted some 'clean' HK food, Tai Hing is the place to go! With many branches around town you are bound to find one and be able to enjoy the consistent quality!Love all the food that is on offer there! And you should definitely try their Iced Milk Tea there!The '8 Treasure Rice' is a must try as well!Food is a tat on the pricy end but I think the assurance of food quality and cleanliness is something that's worth a dollar or two!Damn I'm hungry just typing this review!"
% Arabica,5,"They sure know how to pick their location.  Located in an Instagram hotspot (Transformer's monster buildings), this is a nice reprieve after getting that perfect shot.  A bit pricey, but having tried the single origin and blend versions in Spanish Latte and Cafe Latte, I was impressed by the taste and aroma.  Portions are fairly small but the flavor makes up for it."
% Arabica,4,"If everyone is going to go to this area, its mainly because they want to take the picture of the buildings where Transformers was filmed.After taking pictures, stopping in this coffee shop is a must.Ordered a Latte and it was probably the best latter I've had in a long time.Price is high, but quality and freshness is also high."
% Arabica,5,"One of the best coffee chains in HK. They only serve matcha lattes, and espresso based drinks and there isn't any food choices. The location is a bit hidden which is nice as there aren't crazy lines to get a cup of coffee like the other locations in Hong Kong.  Is at the high end for coffee in terms of price but the quality is worth it."
Espresso Alchemy,4,"Espresso Alchemy is one of the few specialty coffee shops on the Eastern part of Hong Kong island. The coffee here is very good.  It is close to my office and I've had the latte, cappuccino, flat white, and pour over. I've moved towards having a stronger espresso taste and less milk and typically order the piccolo.  I've never had the food here but they do serve pasta lunch sets which include a coffee. If my rating were based on coffee alone I would give 5 stars. However, a lot of people come to coffee shops to hangout and read or talk with friends. This isn't a place to do that. Also they are really lacking in pastry options which are typically really good at higher end coffee shops.d"
Espresso Alchemy,4,"Great spot if you are visiting your friends that work in the marketing agencies nearby, the make a great coffee or hot chocolate but also make some great fresh noodle dishes if you are feeling hungry!"
Espresso Alchemy,4,Wonderful coffee and a life saver for a visiting European who is just a bit fussy when it comes to latte.
Espresso Alchemy,4,"My goto place for a good latte, serves decent sandwiches during lunch hour and banana bread in the late afternoons. Staff always seem to be in a bad mood for some reason."
simplylife Cafe,5,"My all time favourite place for breakfast, brunch and lunch . It is a company under the giant franchise Maxim. (Excuse the nerd in me).Since its opening, simply life has always been strategically located near the buzzing commercial districts. Be it central or quarry bay,  It has forever been in the proximity of my work. Each branch may differ in the food that they offer, being either  a ""salad bar"" and ""restaurant"" stream or both. I mostly feast on their salad, bakery and coffee. In my opinion , simply life offers relatively high quality food for the price that you pay. salad bar choice is relatively unique and tasty ! If you opt for a small salad (~55hkd) you can choose up to 4 types of salad from the bar ( large salad you can choose up to six choice , ~hkd75) Most common salad choice include : corn, cucumber salad, quinoa with mixed fruits, mixed green, beets , Caesar salad, pesto pasta, tomato mix, garlic mushroom.In case you pass by during breakfasts time on weekdays , simply life offers a special breakfast set (27 for a choice of bakery with small coffee). Coffee is strong and very decent . Now you know why there is always a queue 8 am in the morning ...."
simplylife Cafe,1,"Carbonara is one of the most popular pasta dishes.  The traditional Italian version omits the cream, because Italians believe that Carbonara's delicate taste of egg would be ruined with cream, lots of Parmigiani cheese, bacon, garlic and egg.  There's good reason pasta is high on nearly everyone's list of favorites.  Pasta is versatile, healthy, tasty and easy to work with; or just served plain with a fine glass of red wine at home, this simple food can be great for your heart after the crazy working hour after home during weekday.However I tried the carbonara in Simplylife and I felt the challenge on how to describe the taste here, yes it as tasteless and flavorless!  I wont order again here!"
simplylife Cafe,1,"This is a ""last option"" place. The food is basic yet overpriced and the staff needs training on customer service. If you are patient, the staff will eventually help you; however, they may forget your order was put in the oven to heat up as all 5 are having a deep conversation. Hope you have dental insurance! Today the staff gave me a sneer and slid my meal towards me rather than handing it to me.Every time I give this place another chance, I am filled with regret."
simplylife Cafe,5,"Ahh~~simplylife, such music to my ears~Allow me to be slightly over-the-toply sing praise an hail its presence. This is a place for people who are looking for quality food, whether you can sit down and leisurely enjoy or you have to hit the road running; simplylife will most definitely make you day better.Actually it offers a wide variety of foods ranging from freshly baked pastry to Chinese lunch boxes and everything in between. For the mean time i will just skip the latter as i think the best part of simplylife lies in their more western dishes.As a person who is constantly living on a low carb diet, the salads make my life a lot easier without the worries of putting on extra pounds. Roast broccoli with lemon slices, sweet corn from the cob with baby spinach (i do aware that it is some form of carb...), buckwheat and rice salad ( yes..carb that certainly is and i tend not to order it) and much much more. I can bet on whatever that even the strictest veggie haters would love what they see let alone digging straight in. Other than the salads, the burger and fries are just as good. Actually it is just impossible for me to fully express myself in words on how good the food is and the varieties the place could offer. It is simply too good, simply the lifeblood of my life.Simplylife it sure is~"
Ashima Yunnam Restaurant,5,"Ashima is a good restaurant, but wow is it awkward to access. The main entrance is along the outside of the mall, while an unofficial entrance is also located right next to the bathrooms.This place makes excellent noodles of both the fried and soup kind, and they offer very flavourful side dishes too! I wouldn't order Xiaolongbao here (that's Shanghainese, and there's better stuff in the menu anyway...), but you should definitely try the different kinds of buns and snacks. For the more adventurous diners, the pig ears here are very well seasoned and tender, yet slightly chewy. Their pan fried green onion bread (蔥油餅) was impressive, seeing as it it had a light crunch to it, thanks to the sesame seeds on top, and the fragrance of the green onion was well balanced.Prices overall are also quite reasonable, but if you choose to eat early, I.e. around 5, come a little earlier and order off the tea time menu for extra value. Service may not always be the speediest, but the food generally makes up for it."
Greyhound Café,4,"I only really go here for large family dinners. The food is reasonably good, and so is the price.Whenever I'm here, I will always order a Thai iced tea. They actually get them right.Greyhound offers a variety of interesting fusion dishes that actually work including a fusilli Pad Thai that actually turned out nicely. Most places in Hong Kong boil their pasta to the point in which it disintegrates immediately in your mouth, here they actually serve it al dente. While it may not be a Hong Kong norm, that's definitely a plus for me. The squid ink pasta is tasty, and they also make some mean sauté dishes.Serving staff are well trained and friendly, and food is generally quite good, so if you are worried about making a bad choice, just double check with the staff."
Greyhound Café,3,"At first I was a little confused about the name, Greyhound Cafe? Not really sure why that name and I thought it is something ""bus"" related and maybe an American diner?!Greyhound Cafe is a franchise originated from Thailand and now in Hong Kong. Food is Thai Fusion. So you will find quite an interesting menu but the flavour profile is mainly Thai.This has become one of my family favourite place for gathering and of course I ended up coming here when I am in town. Reservation highly recommended as the restaurant is small and you will have 90 minute window to enjoy your meal.We tried quite a few items with some hit and miss. Just be warned they uses fresh thai chili pepper to season quite a bit and if you cannot eat spicy, there are non spicy dish that you might enjoy more.Spaghetti Cha Cha Cha ($128) seems to be the crowd favourite. Chicken Satay was meh... and the raw vegetables skewers that came with it was fail. You must not miss dessert! Mango Sticky Rice and Pandan layer cake both really good!They also offers Afternoon Tea Set which is much better value than dinner a la carte."
Greyhound Café,5,"Perhaps the best Thai export, the Greyhound restaurants in HK are pretty much 95% of the ones in Bangkok. It's Thai with a twist of Chinese, Muslim, western and other stuff combined. I get the impression a rich Thai fella's wife went bananas in the kitchen & her friends told her this would be a great Resturant. I like the complicated noodles. The ice tea where the ice cubes are made of tea so there is no dilution...  Come & go bananas."
Greyhound Café,2,"words of explanation　that Casual Thai restaurant.I feel it in that way.The atmosphere is good, and the class of visitors has many a family and studentsBecause Store in the shopping centerThe dessert is not bad, but feels like not matching a price"
Greyhound Café,4,"Greyhound Cafe recently opened this branch in CityPlaza, I think the food and ambiance here is better than the IFC branch. It serves Asian fusion food and so far everything I have ordered have been good. The place is usually packed since there are few western style restaurants in TaikooShing, but it is possible to make reservations ahead of time. My favorites here are the desserts and lemongrass tea, I also recommend the foie gras and mango salad and crab fried rice."
Jardin de Jade,5,"We showed up at 6pm on a Sunday without a reservation. Fifteen minutes after seated,the place was packed with diners. Although the place was busy, but the staff was cheerful in attending our needs and taking orders. We ordered pig hoof in Chinese wine (川香麻醬豬手) - each bite of the hoof with skin was crisp and with no fatty taste; grainy beef with mushroom (香茶菇爆牛肉) - the beef was tender and soft with the right  combination of mushroom; braised spinach (上湯菠菜)- very soft and no bitter taste; stewed fish fillets in rice wine sauce (糟溜魚片) - was fresh, tasty, and excellent addition of soft cloud ear; and minced chicken with pine nuts wrapped in lettuce (松子雞米生菜包)- each bite of warm chicken wrapped in the cold, crips, and fresh lettuce was just heavenly! Desserts included traditional mung bean cake (傳統綠豆糕) and mango juice with pomelo and fresh mango (楊枝甘露) - highly recommended! The above five dish menu was good for a group of five people. We left without an overwhelming feeling. The diligent staff -servers and managers, did add to an excellent dining experience!"
Jardin de Jade,5,OK so maybe the people who put those Michelin restaurant guides together really do know what they're doing.    This place is sublime.The service is absolutely impeccable (a rarity in Kowloon) and the Shanghai-style food is amazing (flavor and presentation).   I don't have a single complaint (other than there isn't one of these restaurants close to me than a 19-hour flight)
Peking Garden Restaurant,4,"Peking garden is one of the nicer restaurants in City plaza. The restaurant specializes in Peking duck but they serve a variety of different types of Chinese food from Sichuan to Shanghainese to Cantonese. The food here is quite good and is one of the better restaurants in the Tai Koo area. Food: 4 starsService: 3.5 starsEnvironment: 3.5 starsValue: 3.75 starsRecommendations: Peking duck, zhajiang main, potstickersThe Peking duck here is very good and is pretty reasonable at 388 hkd. The duck is paired with hoisin sauce, scallions, cucumber and thin pancakes. The skin could be a bit crispier but other than that I don't have too many complaints. The zhajiang mian here is also very good and is quite authentic and tastes similar to what you would get in Beijing. I would come here again just to order this."
Peking Garden Restaurant,3,"I always ended up coming to Peking Garden Restaurant for my family gatherings. Not here for the delicious food but really for convenient. Located at City Plaza right at Taikoo MRT Station. They also has discount on set menu if you pay by some credit cards with some restriction.Food is mediocre but plentiful. With 5 of us ordering a set menu for 4 and we still have leftover.Service was spotty and rush as they wants to go through as many seating as possible. When we made our reservation they told us we only have 90 minutes time frame, so it is more a eat and go place!"
Peking Garden Restaurant,3,"Peking Garden used to very very good and was toted to be a premium restaurant, at least along the Maxim's Group chain, but it didn't strike me as anything special. Returning on a Sunday evening at 6pm, service was already bustling and busy. The menu, while long, didn't seem to have a wide variety of options. Two Peking ducks were ordered in advance. A little disappointed in their selection of noodles and non-pork friendly dishes. There was only one fried noodle dish and the rest were all soup noodles. Thankfully the removed the pork and substituted with mushrooms. Overall, the food tasted OK, would probably be able to find better Peking duck elsewhere."
Peking Garden Restaurant,4,Wow really good Peking duck. Not greasy. And also not touristy either. This location is in the mall so very convenient if you are already out there. We loved the crispiness of the duck. It was super well done. They had a variety of other traditional Chinese dishes such as stir fries and rice but the main thing here is enjoying the duck to its fullest. The staff is professional and the place super clean and nice so it's a great place to bring the whole extended family to enjoy this great delicacy.
Peking Garden Restaurant,3,"Awesome peking duck Whole roasted Peking duckThinly sliced, roasted just right to give a crisp skin that is not too smokey and carcinogenic. Served with very thin white flour tortilla-like pancakes, raw leeks and cucumbers, and hoisin sauce for dipping. Some cuts were higher fat and oil content, resulting in a richer, smoother and more moist texture, but the leaner cuts were fine.Staff were great job and friendly and took nice pleasure in us not speaking mandarin but were very accommodating and polite."
The Butchers Club Burger,5,"Tldr: The classic is like a classic burger you can get in the states anywhere that serves beerGot the classic and it tasted like a classic burger you can get from San Francisco. The party was medium rare and juicy with a thousand island based special sauce. Slap on some lettuce, tomato, pickles, and a toasted bun satisfied by craving of a good burger."
The Butchers Club Burger,3,"The restaurant opened on the day I departed on my last visit. I wanted to try this restaurant in my last visit already and now finally had a chance. It looks like an American style of burger place. My husband and I ordered two  burgers, double layers and another one was a beef burger with anime fries. I was impressed by the fries. They did tasted delicious with mayonnaise and the Japanese flying flakes. They were a bit spicy but they went well with the  beer.On the other hand, I was a bit disappointed with the burgers  though the presentation was good and a but deceiving. The patties were big but didn't taste as good. To be frank, they didn't have any taste but needed to rely on the sauce to make the burgers complete. I may come back for the fries but the burger is not to my personal taste."
The Butchers Club Burger,5,"This place is so good! We went back three times in one week. Granted, I'm an American who may have just been deprived of good, classic American food, but I found the experience great overall. The interior is very modern, with old school American hip hop playing in the background. The wait staff is excellent as well - super friendly and on their toes, despite the fact that it gets pretty busy in here during lunch hour. And of course, the burgers and fries are delicious - I had their ""Beyond Classic"" vegan burger each time and was never disappointed. They also have a burger that has grilled cheese sandwiches instead of buns, which was apparently incredible as well!"
The Big Bite,4,"This place has the best burgers I've tasted in Hong Kong.  They have a wide variety of burger and sandwiches, everyone should be able to to find something that they like. The root beer float is exactly what you would expect a root beer float to be. The one thing that nobody in our group liked was the chicken strips.  They were cut into strips less than 1cm thick; which when fried gets very tough to chew. I have a feeling why they are cut into thin strips, to make it look like you are getting a lot. I think a better option would be to cut them into thicker strips and add a couple fries under them. I will definitely be back, but ill stick to the burgers in this burger joint."
The Big Bite,4,"My very first time visiting this place was years ago. Shout out to their Tuesday Wing's Night! Classic. Friendly staff, good North American eats at decent Hong Kong prices. It's a non-zero-sum game. Literally - especially if you decide to challenge your mates to homicidal wings. Their spicy ratings goes from: Honey Garlic, Wuss, Cajin, Mild, Medium, Hot, Suicide and Homicide. I could feel that numbing, tingling sensation on my face as I ingested my 3rd suicide wing. And as I gasped for water and reached for tissue to wipe my drool, I could here this lovely Swiss man sitting three seats away from me, telling customers he's a regular there and that he would never dare go beyond Medium.  And that's when I decided that my friend should get the Homicide ones, because if there was a moment to capture what a sucker I am... that would be it. One homicide wing in, my insides were nuked. Perhaps I should have eaten breakfast and lunch first. I feel that their homicide wings should come with a sympathy glass of milk. They don't... so that was cruel of them. Good game, Big Bite.Special shout out to their A&W root beer floats for when you miss home! Their poutine was...acceptable. If you ask me, their Sai Wan branch is better. Less people and more space!"
The Big Bite,5,"A sad update for those living in Happy Valley - these guys stopped delivering to our neighborhood! One word: heartbroken. Ah well, I guess a group outing is in order."
The Big Bite,4,"The weekend breakfast, available all day to 6pm is quite a good deal. 95 hkd for eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, baked beans, fried tomato, and oj!"
The Big Bite,5,"Unapologetically Canadian and seriously good dogs, burgers and wings. The location is kinda out of the way in North Point, but if you are craving some great grub, this place will hit the spot. And yes, poutine! Besides Sidewalk in lkf, this is where I go to satisfy my gravy-cheese craving.Fine little selection of Canadian microbreweries as well."
The Big Bite,4,"Rather strangely located in North Point, and not even on King's Road, but the ""back alley"" that is Java Road, is a great burger cafe - Big Bite.With the advent of Beef & Liberty and Butchers Club Burger, it seems that the humble burger is making some waves in the culinary scene in HK. Well, Big Bite has been a little known stalwart in the burger kingdom for sometime now, and for good reason.They serve a simple menu of burgers and dogs, with various fries and drinks. I say simple, because by concept it is. However, the menu may betray otherwise, as it is a bit of a head bender trying to workout what is and is not in the meal deal etc. So remember to pull out your PHD in statistical analysis before embarking into the menu. Alternatively, just point and grunt.The burgers are brilliant. 100% ground US beef, they are cooked really nicely, so they retain that lovely crumbly dry texture, without being just mince in a bun. The bun is a lovely soft and light wisp of a thing, perfectly framing the pattie and whatever else you can cram in. Unfortunately, I do have a grumble though, the burger was a bit luke warm, and I put this down to the service.I don't know what is going on with the service, but it sucks. It's not even a proper restaurant, in that you order and pay at the counter before taking a table, but even with only one part of the waiting service to do (i.e. bringing me my burger), they take an absolute ice age, bring everything at differing times, and forget stuff. The total result is a cold burger, followed 10 mins (and three requests) later with poutine that is hotter than the sun. Unfortunately, this sucky service puts a big black mark across the food. I doubt that the chef likes his burgers to be cold at the table, unless that is the Canadian style of serving them?Definitely give it a go, as you can get a really good burger for much less than the fancy boys. Just keep on top of the wait staff and get your food out at the same time - hot. Maybe sit up by the pass at the high tables, so you can be all over them.One last brownie point; they have an excellent selection of beers, and on Tuesdays, you can add HKD3 with any beer purchase for buffalo wings - get out the blue cheese!"
The Big Bite,5,"Great food. We tasted the Fat Bastard X2, suicide wings, chili cheese fries, chocolate shake, EVERYTHING was delicious.  The price is fair for Hong Kong. I would most definitely recommend it. Cheers!!"
The Big Bite,4,"Really great burger joint with affordable items. The place is a bit tucked away, but that also means that it isn't overcrowded like it would be if it were located more centrally. I really like that you don't feel pressured to just eat and go (which is very rare in Hong Kong)They have pretty much all the standards you would expect from a BBQ place. Burgers, wings, onion rings and all types of fries. The novelty and *cool factor was the Canadian craft beers (and HK!) selection which you wouldn't really find elsewhere.I ordered the standard burger (always a good starting point to judge a restaurant) with a bottle of HK craft beer, and it all came to HKD$56, which I thought was quite good. I was expecting an undersized burger, but no, it was actually decently sized.The burger was super juicy and was done maybe around a medium well done, which I liked. I really hate burgers that are overcooked and dry. I didn't find this out later, but the pickled jalapeño in the burger was a really nice touch and gave a lil kick to the taste.I would definitely go back and try the other stuff!!"
The Big Bite,3,I ordered a cheese burger and fries with Taters'n Cream Sets.It took around fifteen minutes for the food.The beef wasn't  very juicy and the fries weren't freshly made. A little bit disappointed by that.I'll give a score of 5/6 out of 10
The Big Bite,3,"The Big Bite is marketed as a Canadian eatery which serves Canadian beer and Canadian food (whatever that's supposed to be). I was born and raised in Canada so I think I would have a slight idea of what. It's supposed to be like. I heard so much about it before I went myself for the very first time. People were raving about the wings, the beer, the poutine. I finally went on wings night which is on Tuesdays. They do wings for very cheap. To be fair, the prices were excellent, very economical as opposed to a lot of other bars. Were they of good standard in terms of taste? No. The wings were a bit on the dry side, the hot dogs met the bare minimum requirement and the poutine was not as good as ny fries. The ambience they set up was good however. It was a fun environment and they had a good crowd. I would go back for the vibe, not so much for the food. There's lots of space for improvement in terms of food."
The Big Bite,2,Had the cheeseburger and it had way too much sauce on it.  I could only eat half of it.  The mushroom poutine was better but they don't use real cheese curds so they are more like disco fries than poutine.  If you've had real poutine in Canada it would be a disappointment although I've had poutine a few times around Asia and no one seems to be able to source real Quebec cheese curds so it's probably the best you're going to get.
The Big Bite,3,"Sunday night 18:45 pm. Want to like to this place.... Burgers, poutine, fries, beers ARE good and staff visibly hardworking BUT after +45 mins for our meal, I don't think we will ever come back. They gotta change their system, it is a fast food joint after all !! Can see many upset customers waiting (one waited over 1 hr, got a refund and left). Also saw FoodPanda's frustration, unable to deliver their orders."
Minh & Kok,4,Fast casual south East Asian spot that serves rice and noodle dishes as well as street food style snacks. The food here is pretty good. I think the quality has gone down a bit since it first opened. Worth coming here for the lunch set which is between 78-100 hkd depending on if you do the appetizer plate or not.  Don't expect any real type of service other than the staff taking your order and bringing out your food. When it gets busy you will also have to flag down the staff to get some service.
Minh & Kok,2,"To avoid the weekend crowd, we got to the place at 11am. We ordered the Laksa noodle soup with roasted chicken thigh which came with a drink. We had to wait for 20 minutes. The chicken came out dry, tough, and overcooked. The noodles were soggy. The soup was just spicy but not hot. It was quite disappointing.In addition, the price is $2 more per bowl on weekend."
Minh & Kok,1,"Not sure why there are high ratings, maybe is the Vietnamese food that is good, we ordered several Thai dishes... all horrible... one of the worst Thai food we have ever had... and expensive, my family said it is very good went they visit previously, could be new chef...Do not order those have crosses on the receipt...The Prawn Cake & the Pork Jow are the only two dishes that can consider to order..."
Minh & Kok,4,"Located inside the Treats Food Court, Minh & Kok is a nice option for when you don't feel like scavenging for a seat.  Of course it's a little more pricey than the food court, but you do get the better seating and wait service! For those that have been to the Minh & Kok in Causeway Bay, it's basically the same dishes. Though the options here are much less than the other location. However they do have some lunch sets available. Overall it's a decent alternative option to the food court right outside."
Minh & Kok,5,"Pleasantly surprised by the flavours!The two of us shared one lunch set menu and a pomelo salad. It comes with an entree of your choice (rice or noodle dish), and a small bites sampler. The spring roll was A-MAZING. Next time we would definitely go with a full order. The pad thai could use a little more fish sauce but I could just be accustomed to the taste in US. The highlight of the pad thai was the freshness of the shrimps they use. Now I know Ive been eating frozen shrimps all along =(. The Pomelo salad is a refreshing accompaniment to go along with the meal, with crispy shallot and a hint of fish sauce. Oh and the egg coffee ($15 upcharge from the set menu)!! It was brûlée on top. Im done.Bill came out to be just at $200. We were perfectly satisfied. So glad we found this solid place out of the many options in and around the plaza."
Hokkaidon,5,"Newly opened, comfortable and quiet seating. The sashimi is very fresh, the rice is real japanese rice, fluffy and sweet. Love the condiments aside. Little dried fish with sweet mirin sauce? And the seaweed salad. That everything goes well and enjoing every bite.The miso soup is tasty, not saltly. I also tried the grill eel. Thick sauce on top, great texture of eel. I love it."
Hokkaidon,4,I came here for the lunch set on a weekday.  Like all places in this area lunchtime is really busy so I would suggest getting here before 12:00 pm to avoid the lines.They have non sushi items but the thing to order here is the sashimi. I had the special tuna don which is a bit on the pricey side but in line with what you would pay in Hong Kong (200 hkd). The tuna is definitely high quality and had a nice texture to it.  I would definitely recommend ordering it. This isn't a place I would go every day but it's nice to treat yourself to a nice lunch on occasion. Overall rating based on: Food: 4 starsEnvironment/Service: 3 starsValue: 4 starsOverall: 3.5 stars
Yu Sum Vietnamese Restaurant,3,"I continue my search of good Vietnamese food in Hong Kong to no avail. This place felt more like fusion Chinese and Vietnamese than truly authentic Viet. I ordered the grilled pork neck meat vermicelli. Similar to other Vietnamese restaurants in Hong Kong, the vermicelli is slightly hard and I wish there were more veggies in it. The grilled pork neck meat was pretty good. It was flavorful and had a good crunchy texture.It is rather affordable though. All of the popular items come in a set with a drink for $43. I had the mung bean in coconut milk drink. I thought it was weird that the mung beans came in chunks. I wouldn't be hurrying back to this place and I'll continue my hunt."
Xi Dian,4,"Solid place for the lunch crowd. It's surprisingly located inside an office/factory building. I guess you wouldn't know about this place unless someone brings you here.Walk into the lobby and take the lift to the 12th floor.  Then once you exit the lift its located on the left hand side.  From the many times I've been here, usually there will be someone else in the lift going to the same place!The restaurant is pretty big itself.  Its got a few small tables and plenty of big round ones.  Although there's plenty of seats, usually its pretty full during lunch time.  You almost always have to wait to be seated if you arrive during lunch hours.  Almost everything on the menu is part of a set during lunch. Set meaning that you get a soup along with dessert for the main you've chose. The good thing about this place is that the menu constantly changes so you will never get bored if you frequent it.  Sadly the menu is only in Chinese, so if you cant read Chinese, better come with a friend who can.  I've been here plenty of times, and the food is always good.  The only downfall is the wait.  Having to wait for a table as well as your food, make sure you have at least an hour during lunch if you want to eat here."
Enoteca,3,"I was craving a pizza so we came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch/brunch.Simply, the pizza was good and satisfied my craving. The crab cakes were a thumbs down though - so skip the crab cakes and try something else.That. Is. All."
Enoteca,1,"I order a simple steak and a beer, after one hour waiting for my steak, I cancelled the order and leftTheir kitchen must be very smallNot recommended"
Enoteca,3,"Location location location.In Hong Kong, where you are determines who you are.  Enoteca is located smack in the middle of Taikoo place, which is the largest office area of Hong Kong east. So being there usually automatically defines a venue as a 1) lunch spot, 2) happy hour place or a 3) cafe. Enoteca is 1) and 2). It is in such a prime spot you cannot ignore it. It has indoor and outdoor seating. The Island East fair is held in its outdoor area, which is actually a wonderful place to be in during cooler seasons. If you work in Taikoo place, chances are this is the first place you see when you come down to lunch. But because it is pricier than most other neighboring eateries, charging around Hkd 130 - 200 for a lunch set, chances are there are usually walk in seats too. Lunch food is not spectacular, the steak is usually mediocre - my companion did not finish hers today because it was "" too chewy"", and this was her second time trying the same dish. I have the ahi tuna usually, which I think is decent, even though they give you a strange spicy Mediterranean dip. Happy hour though, that's when things change. This is when you actually need to fight for a table. The place becomes a bustling, wondrous place of tired or exuberant office workers, looking to unwind, gossip or complain. The vibe is great and the wine is decent - ""Enoteca"" does mean wine store after all. They have brunch and special deals on weekends, like their 178 for a pitcher of beer and a pizza. Very good deal, tells you how much( little) business there is on non working days. So come for drinks, but don't go out of your way to visit. You can't miss it if you're in the neighborhood anyway."
Enoteca,4,"4-stars for the brunch as it is relatively good bang for the buck.  Apparently lunch and dinner on weekdays are more expensive.  This is what our party ordered this time:Smoked salmon rosti - goodSalad with Greek yogurt - yogurt was fine, salad okFish in beer batter - ok, a little salty but chips were nice.We were here on Sunday 1pm and it was relatively empty.  Starts filling up from 2.30pm again.In the past we have tried various pizza, and those were generally good.  Will be back to try the paella, which the next table seems to be happily feasting on - and which smells really fragrant.Service is reasonably good and service staff helpful."
Enoteca,4,"My friends and I were walking around in Quarry Bay when we decided that we were getting tired and wanted to sit down for a drink. Since it was around 5pm, the same idea popped into everybody's heads - happy hour!We decided to go to Enoteca opposite Taikoo Place. It's really easy to find - if you know where the Island East Markets are on Sunday, that's exactly where it is. I like how Enoteca spills out and has tables and chairs outside, so you can choose to dine alfresco. Since it's away from the main road, the air's pretty clean (or as clean as it can get in HK...) so your food and drinks aren't sucking up all that pollution.Between the four of us, we ordered three drinks - a cosmopolitan, Strongbow cider and Coopers sparkling ale - and some potato wedges to share. The drinks were quite reasonably priced, and they came almost immediately. And they were good - nothing like some refreshing beer on a hot summer day!Our potato wedges took its time to come, but we weren't in any hurry so it was fine. The wedges were really, really good - they came out steaming hot and golden fried, and I couldn't eat them for the first minute or so because they were so hot! And the dip that it came with was really nice too - paprika and coriander dip - surprising because I normally dislike coriander.The service here was great and one of them, I assume is probably a manager, was hilarious. One of my friends is not a keen drinker and didn't order anything (she was going to get just juice but then decided not to). He saw her without anything to drink and asked him if she would like some cold water 'on the rocks' - we all laughed, and she agreed. Seconds later, he was back with a glass of ice water with a straw, and he told her 'careful, don't drink too much!' Unfortunately, we never caught his name, but you will recognize him as the one with the really jolly voice.Overall, I'm glad we decided to come to Enoteca. The food, the drinks and the service were all great and not too expensive. Since this is located near the office area, expect it to get pretty filled if you come by at around 6pm with people headed for their after-work drinks!"
Starbucks,5,I enjoy coming here for morning espresso and team when working on Hong Kong. Batista Amy is extra nice and sweet.
Starbucks,4,"Good old Starby! This one is the only one I have gone to in HK since its in the way to work and I can just grab a coffee and cinnamon Danish if I need a quick bfast. Usually the line gets pretty long in the morning from 8:30-9 but dies down after 9:30. Service here is pretty nice and quick as well. I usually get the Chai tea latte or caramel macchiato. As usual, you can ask for skim or soy milk and they have the tall, grande, and bento sizes. One thing I have noticed about the soy caramel macchiato though is that it tastes oddly slightly bitter... And even with skim milk it tastes a little weird to me... Just not the same as back in the states... Maybe it's just the milk they use? But the chai tea latte tastes ok to me. They do have unique holiday flavors like gingerbread, toffee but, and even panettone! I was so excited for the panettone one since I love the bread! But it was kinda meh... It was just a regular sweet latte with some whipped cream and tried fruit bits sprinkled on top... Although I'm not sure really what I was expecting with a panettone latte... Anyhoo one thing that did make me really sad is that they don't have the pumpkin spice latte for fall!!!! As a basic American girl, that is all I ask for during my fall holiday season :'( Overall, just a normal Starbucks which means it is good!"
Wildfire,5,Crazy Bernie is a huge fan of this small but delicious chain of locally owned pizza joints. I try to visit them all each and every trip to HK. The name says it all. Their pizzas are thin and delicious. Cooked in a super hot fired oven and done in minutes. I could eat here every meal.
Wildfire,2,"The pizza here is pretty bad. I would rather have a chain like Pizza Hut over this place. Had the black and white pizza, where they advertised black truffle. The black truffle was a paste which was splattered on the pizza. I had trouble finishing which is hard to do for pizza. Even something I buy frozen from the supermarket I can finish. I've come on another occasion to have the brunch, which was much better. Buffett is nothing to write home about but the steak was decent given the price point."
Pizzeria Jacomax,4,"This is your typical neighborhood pizza joint located in Quarry Bay next to Tai Koo Place. Jacomax is not very big, setting is simple with a few stylish decors. Service is efficient and friendly. They have a decent drinks list with some nice cocktails and mocktails. The selection for craft beers is nice, too. All the classic Italian dishes are on the menu. Pasta is cooked al dente to perfection, no faults there. The pizzas are great as well, crispy, nice selection of toppings, not oily at all. I like their salads as well which are fresh with a tasty dressing. Jacomax is inexpensive."
Pizzeria Jacomax,4,"Jacomax is a pretty unassuming pizza place in Quarry Bay, and the lunch sets are good value for money - you will most definitely leave full. They have lunch sets for 2 up to 6 people, and the structure is Pizza + Pasta + Wings/Sides + Salad + Drink. For 2 people, it would be one of each food and 2 drinks, so you can imagine the amount of food they give you. For 6 people you get 2 of each, plus 6 drinks, and one time when we ordered this set, they accidentally gave us 3 pastas but nicely let us keep the extra one for free - I was asleep at my desk for most that afternoon.The pastas are generally decent but harder than the al dente that other Italian places in HK do. The pizzas are great, and the selection is large, although a bit on the dry, biscuit-y side, and not as good as the more established (chain owned) pizzerias like Linguini Fini and Piccolo. I heard the owner Jacomax is usually based in the Sheung Wan shop and actually makes the pizzas himself, so perhaps that's where you can find the best quality. One thing I appreciate is that they have a fun approach to making pizzas. When I first came to the area during October, they had a Halloween theme where the store was dressed up in a spooky theme and there were actually Halloween pizzas! It was pretty fun to see little ghosts and pumpkin scattered on your pizzas, squid ink (I think) was used instead of tomato paste to create a black backdrop and make it all the more spookier. And pricing is around HKD125/person (HKD 750 for a 6 person meal), much cheaper than you can get at the chains I mentioned just now. Pretty sweet deal!"
Red Star Restaurant & Pub,5,Just a hole on the wall. Tiny place. But good quality food. Big portion too. Second visit for breakfast. Will come back again.
Red Star Restaurant & Pub,4,"Had ribeye steak last night, not bad but can't compare to Outback, my friend had ox tail which I ate 1/3 of them, a lot more tastier and tender than my steak, dinner comes with bread, soup and coffee or tea.I know what to order next time."
Wang Jia Sha,5,"王家沙 is the Chinese name of this restaurant (totally don't understand what became of the English, sounds like a direct translation haha). Anyway, this place has always been one of my family's go-to lunch places back in HK whenever we are around the Taikoo Shing area. Their dishes are mainly Shanghainese.I always found their decor interesting because they pretty much stuck tea pots and plates sideways on the walls of different colours - pretty neat! Service is decent, it varies. Sometimes when they are super busy, it's hard to flag down a waiter. But when it's casual, they notice you easily and would refill your tea constantly.Their soup dumplings and pan-fried buns are super delicious! The dumplings are made well so that the soup is secured inside yet the dumpling skin is thin (key component to look for in a soup dumpling). As for the buns, the bottom is fried and burnt just right while the inside is saucy and steamy too. I think all their cold dishes are great - any pick would be a good choice!Their main dishes and noodles are not bad too. They have a large selection of both noodles and rice. Our family especially likes the soy-sauced noodles with yellow eel as well as dan-dan noodles 擔擔麵."
Wang Jia Sha,3,"Quick tip: don't sit near the front next to the kitchen pass. They do a lot of their unloading of dishware around there and it will Came down here for a late dinner after work. It was not that busy at around 8:30/9 on a week night. We ordered the Iberico pork dan dan noodles, cold noodle appetizer, and runny custard bun.Everything was pretty ordinary, nothing to come back especially for. The Iberico pork was actually served as a fried cutlet on the side rather than in the noodle.The only thing I would go back for was the custard bun. It's hard to find the runny kind nowadays esp with a quality bun around it! This was the best I've had in a while!"
Wang Jia Sha,1,"Inattentive, indifferent, it's as if I was never there!I was standing at the counter in plain sight, I tried to get a table for 4, but for some reason, the host was helping everyone who lined up behind me!They need to get their act together!It doesn't matter if a restaurant has good good but embarrassingly bad service. Just because I don't look Chinese isn't grounds to ignore me!"
Q-Bay Burger,5,"This is highly likely one of the best burgers I've had in Hong Kong.I had the Parisian Burger ($85) - Beef patty with swiss cheese, grilled/seasoned onions, truffle cream sauce. Ordered a medium rare and it came out perfect. Juicy, well-seasoned, normal-sized. Onions tasted great with the way they seasoned it. Truffle cream sauce wasn't overly thick or heavy as I thought it would be. Bun didn't get soggy at all and stayed put together until the very last bite.It comes with a side of fries with ketchup. It wasn't a lot of fries, but I thought it was the perfect amount with the burger.Iced lemon tea that is self-serve is $10 and tasted really good!No complaints. Small joint with just one person taking order and cooking, but I found them to be efficient, and I was VERY happy with this lunch choice."
Q-Bay Burger,3,"Being new to the Quarry Bay area, of course I immediately started doing research on what there was to eat around there and Q-Bay Burger caught my eye because they serve turkey burgers! I convinced my coworkers to give it a try for lunch.I am sad to announce that their turkey burgers are not fantastic. I knew I was in trouble when the burger came and the patty was square shaped :/ The meat was rubbery and did not feel like real turkey at all. At least it was juicy though. The only reason I'm giving this a 3-star rating is because the other people had their beef burger and raved about it. To the point where they think it's the best burger they've had in Hong Kong. I'll have to go back and try that instead. There aren't that many seats in this place, like max 12 seats so be prepared. Pricing also isn't bad. I believe my turkey burger was around $70 and that already includes a side of fries."
Q-Bay Burger,3,"Hong Kong has its fair share of burger joints, there are the big chains obviously like Mcds, Triple Os and Burger King; the standalone gourmet places like Burgerroom, CaliBurger(which is actually a chain in the States); the bars that serve burgers as an attraction, think McSorley's; and the oh-so-pricey hotel lobby lounge burgers. Main St Deli anyone?QBay burger seems to be none of those. It is special in that it is a small, unassuming, almost ghetto burger joint in Quarry Bay. It is directly in competition with Burger Mix, another small store that is literally doors away. Burger Mix actually is bit more refined - they have a logo and proper printed wrappers, and a second store. Qbay Burger is more mom and pop, but what it lacks in scale and slickness, it makes up for in heart.Each burger is made to order, meaning yes, you will have to wait long times for your burger. So go BEFORE 12:30 if you have a short lunch break. I tried both the namesake Qbay Burger and the Milano Burger, for takeout. Qbay burger was simple: patty, cheese, tomato, onion and lettuce. The poppy seed bun was toasted and patty was quite succulent with that beef flavor. Portions were generous as well, a burger fries combo should be enough to induce a coma back at the desk. I was happy with that one.Milano Burger was a wannabe gourmet burger, with bacon, rocket and provolone cheese. This was saaalty. Could've been the bacon or the cheese, but either way this was not the delicate gourmet burger I imagined. Gourmet does not seem to be their repertoire.So overall, a small store with heart, and decent basic burger. The price is similarly priced to Triple Os, around HKD 70~80 a combo with fries and a drink."
Tulsi Indian Restaurant,4,A nice and cosy Indian restaurant. Not full on a weekday evening but with a few tables filled it's not quiet in the restaurant. I found out it's a Michelin-recommended restaurant only when I was reading the menu. Even with that expectation the tandori chicken and spinach curry lamb were very nice (and we forgot to take pictures of them). And there is a variety of beer to choose that goes well with the dishes.
Tulsi Indian Restaurant,3,"Tulsi is tucked away in the corner of a building and isn't really that easy to find. It was one of the few Indian restaurants in the area and is a good choice for lunch. They offer vegetarian and non vegetarian sets that are priced at 75 hkd. The set comes with nam, rice and a few dishes portioned in snack style portions. They also offer single dish sets if you don't want the variety. Food: 3.5 starsEnvironment: 2.5 starsService: 3 starsValue: 4 starsThe service is efficient and the food comes out quick but don't expect much in terms of interaction from the staff. They will acknowledge you and take your order and give you your food and that's about it. The food is ok and nothing really special. My office had a few vendors that were from India based in HK for a few months and they wouldn't eat here. For me the food is not that bad and fills a need when I want Indian for lunch."
West Villa Restaurant,3,"Im not a big fan of yum cha due to its lack in variety and its calorie content. To me, yum cha food always surrounds round prawn dumpling, BBQ pork bun, stream Cheung fun. You know, the typical things.However, when it comes to west villa yum cha, I'm  excited! Not only does the food taste good, the variety they offer is endless. It is rare in Hong Kong now a days to stumble upon a old restaurant that still offers the good old choices . A highly recommended place for those of you who are feeling abit adventurous and want to explore that ""hongkie-ness"" in you ."
West Villa Restaurant,2,"Expensive dim-sum and awful service from the wait-staff. They have a special dimsum price that lasts till halfway through the morning, I do believe it is 10am. Apparently, their well-known dishes are their beef and egg  rice, which in my opinion was very standard and typical (nothing that special). If anything, their portions seem smaller than other dimsum joints. But do beware that on weedays there are grandmothers and grandpas lining up outside the restaurant before it even opens up, so go early if you'd like to try it out. It's locaated in the Cityplaza right above Tai Koo MTR, so super convenient and accessible."
West Villa Restaurant,4,"This tasty Cantonese spot is tucked away in a corner of Cityplaza, but is no secret among locals in the neighborhood who pack the restaurant for lunch.  A surprisingly massive establishment given its narrow entrance, the setup is a traditional banquet-hall style with lots of tables and a focus on groups.Many of your dim sum staples can be found here (rice rolls, har gau, xiao long bao, buns, etc.), along with quality seafood, noodle and rice dishes.  I had been told to keep an eye out for the Char Siu (not bao -- just the straight BBQ pork) and boy am I glad that I did.  While everything was good, this dish was a real standout and I definitely ate more than my fair share, even at a work lunch where I would normally restrain myself.  Highly recommended!  Although the menu and order card have English translations, it definitely facilitated the experience to have a native Cantonese speaker with us.  I am sure we would have gotten on just fine if she wasn't there, but it made things a whole lot easier.I can definitely recommend West Villa for fun group lunches for those based in Taikoo, or for a not-that-fancy work lunch for visiting colleagues.  I am not certain that I'd make the trek to Taikoo especially to eat here, but I'm happy to know that it's near the office and look forward to a return visit."
West Villa Restaurant,1,Worst service at lunch time. Took 30 minutes for two dishes dim sums . Credit cad charge took 15 minutes more
The Coffee Academïcs,4,"This opening of this location of the Coffee Academïcs was something I was anticipating for a while. Really convenient for me to grab a cup of coffee on my way to work. They have a outside facing counter top designed for getting your coffee to go. My rating is based on the following:Coffee: 4.5 starsFood: 3.5 starsExperience: 4 starsRecommend: the Istanbul (seasonal drink), & iced cappuccino The coffee here is one of the better coffees in town. They have some unique offerings here where you can have coffees flavored with various different sweeteners (agave, Manuka honey, Okinawa sugar). They also offer seasonal drinks which change periodically. My favorite drink here is the Istanbul. The pour over options are done by a machine. The barista claims that it makes a more consistent cup of coffee but it really detracts from the experience and really makes me question the high cost if this isn't done by hand. I buy my beans for use at home here and the offerings they have from Indonesia are my favorite (West Java or blue roca). Price is bit cheaper than other shops especially if you use the prepaid charge card. One complaint is that their beans are not always recently roasted and can be over a month old.The food here is pretty good if you grade on a scale of cafe food. A bit on the pricey end but still nothing crazy. I wouldn't come here for the food but wouldn't mind eating here. The baked goods are ok and not something I would order."
The Coffee Academïcs,4,"The Coffee Academics seems to be popping up around town. This is one of their newest location. Hidden away in a semi commercial residential area. It is more relax and chill than the Wanchai location I had been to on this trip.All Day Breakfast is the way to go and probably the best deal if you want to have a flat white and something to eat. For me, coffee though is the star. Piccolo Latte ($36+10% SC) is not something I would indulge myself daily at this price point. But the barista pulled a perfect shot and made beautiful latte art in this small glassware with nicely frothed milk."
Hakodate Japanese Restaurant,4,"My Japanese coworker recommended this place to me. His wife who isn't really a big ramen lover was a big fan of this place.  The first time I came here I ordered a rice set and really didn't think the food was anything special. My rating is based on:Food: 4 starsService/environment: 3 stars Value: 4 starsRecommendations: miso ramen, fried chickenThis time around I ordered to miso rich ramen and had a totally different experience. If you come here you need to order the ramen dishes. The soup is a bit on the salty side but it was rich, and full of umami flavor. The ramen doesn't come with an egg so that is a must add on. The soft boiled egg was done properly and came with a semi runny orange yolk. I also added on the larvae fried chicken and I would recommend this as well. The karate here is really quite good. Will come back when I can get out of the office for an early lunch."
Cohhee,5,"Excellent coffee and excellent baristas at this small little coffee CART in the Berkshire House! They claim to open early but they're sometimes there, sometimes not. Regardless, I envy all the people who work in this building because they have access to such good coffee right on the ground floor! Do the baristas get tired from standing all day behind their cart??? Everything is from Australia. The beans. The milk. The owner. The baristas. The personality. The baristas lived in Australia for some years.I'm their newest fan!! Why am I in this building?? The Consulate General of Canada is upstairs. Yay!!"
Cohhee,3,Cohhee is a small coffee cart which offers a large list of coffee options. I had the Flat white here and really wasn't too impressed. The coffee quality is similar quality to Starbucks.  On the plus side they do have a long list of drink options and they have drinks with coffee and ice cream. I will unlikely come back because there are better options in the area.
TeaWood Taiwanese Cafe & Restaurant,5,"The dinner sets were an unexpectedly delicious deal. The set includes an entree, a beverage, and a dessert, all of your choosing, and comes with a bowl of rice. All that for about 100 HKD. Especially worth mentioning were the Three Cup Rice (三杯雞) and the pineapple cake, which had real pineapple bits inside. [Also, currently they're doing a Chibi Maruko-Chan (ちびまる子ちゃん / 小丸子) promotion which is a bonus!]"
TeaWood Taiwanese Cafe & Restaurant,3,"We showed up at 2 pm, too early for the mid afternoon (2:30 pm and after) menu, but late for the lunch (11:30 am to 2:30 pm) menu. The lunch set menu is very attractive with 3 choices of appetizer, 5 choices of main course, and 4 choices of rice/noodle. The price is reasonable. However they ran out of 3 choices of main course. We had no choice but to order the stewed beef brisket with okra/teawood noodles with stewed beef and sweet and sour pork loin with pineapples/rice with marinated minced pork in Taiwanese style. We usually don't like to eat okra because of its slimy taste. But the combination of beef brisket and small prices of okra was just perfectly delicious! The pork loin was very tender and not oily. They even ran out of barley water with red bean! So we settled for the left over choices of rose tea and grapefruit tea! The service was minimal."
Bib N Hops,4,"The Quarry Bay location is close to my office and I have been here a couple of times for lunch. The restaurant concept is a Korean fusion theme that is part of the Alvin Leoung restaurant group. The lunch menu has evolved since it first opened and now is a much tighter and more wallet friendly. The lunch set comes with salad or soup, a main and tea or coffee. You can add dessert for 25 hkd. The price ranges from 100-150 hkd per set.  There is a service charge here so that will add an additional 10%. The mains are divided into three categories: salads, sandwiches/burgers, rice bowls. I opted for the fried chicken rice bowl. I have had the stone pot rice bowls in the past and those are quite good. Better than Food box and Myeung Ga which are your other choices in this area. The fried chicken here is recommended. The batter is nice and crispy and the meat is juicy and tender. They use a go-chu-jang glaze for the chicken which gives a nice sweet and spicy kick to the chicken. The fried egg had a nice orange yolk and paired surprisingly well with the rice. I will definitely come back again and put this into my rotation of lunch restaurants."
Bib N Hops,4,"I didn't try the food at all.Came here for drinks and this place has some great hoegaarden and Asahi on tap. Great service as waiters/waitresses will kindly provide plastic cups for beer takeaway. Lovely outdoor seating under a tarp for even if it's raining, and we enjoyed watching England thrash Panama in the World Cup. Better stick to building canals, buddy.On account of my experience here I'd definitely come back and try their food as well. More to come!"
Myung Ga Korean Restaurant,4,"The legit Korean restaurant around work. You always know it's decent when there are Korean speaking staffs and Korean customers . This restaurant has a decent crowd and if you come before 12:30, there should always be seating . Though $120 lunch can be on the pricey end. It is a highly recommended place for business lunches that is not overly formal . Whenever I come, I always get no. 10 on the menu , sweet sauce beef rib pot . The set meal come with rice, soup , hot tea and refillable side dish upon request. The place to be for a hearty meal !"
築地Gindaco,4,"Really good takoyaki -- filling is very melty and flavorful, and the outside is the perfect texture. The sauces pair well together. Very worth the price!"
築地Gindaco,4,"Gindaco is a large takoyaki chain from Japan.  My four star rating is based on the following:Food: 5 starsService: 3 starsRecommend: takoyaki regular w/o the egg toppingThe quality and taste of the takoyaki is on par with the branches I have tried in Tokyo.  The outer shell has a nice crispy texture and when you break it open the warm dough on the inside is delicious. The Worcester, mayo and bonito flakes all really compliment each other. The biggest difference being the Tokyo branches would have a lot more options to order. I haven't tried the yakisoba here but I imagine that would be good here also. I would give it five stars if it weren't for the unfriendliness of the staff. It's in a food court so I don't expect good service but  at least I don't want to be seen as a nuisance for trying to make an order. I come here all the time for a snack after work."
The Codfather Oyster and Seafood Bar,4,A pretty good western lunch place with some outdoor seating if you work in/ near Taikoo. I'm not actually sure if this was place serves fish n chips as I would think to why they are named the Codfather.... But their steak and pasta are pretty good! Comparable to Jubal which is a street over. Service is pretty decent and fast too. Price is about 100hkd per person.
With Your Mind,4,"With your mind is located on small street in Quarry Bay. They serve Malaysian/Singaporean food at a pretty fair price. It's not 100% authentic but the food here is pretty good.  Food: 3.75 starsService/Environment: 3.25 starsValue: 4 starsOverall: 3.5 starsRecommendations: laksa, Malaysian chickenThe place gets really busy during lunch time on weekdays. Like most fast casual places in Hong Kong don't expect really attentive service. They will take your order and deliver your food and that's about it. They do have delivery through the Deliveroo service."
With Your Mind,4,"First time comer but I think I may become a regular here .I was first recommended here by my friend who had warned me that I may get addicted to the place. They are right.Today I tried their hainan chicken laksa as laksa seemed to dominated the menu . The BF opted for Malay fried flat noodle.Flavours were full on and authentic . My laksa soup was on the spicy side but it was so thick and legit !  The Hainan chicken was served on the side and I also got the three special sauce ( ginger, chilli and sweet soya) for the chicken ( as you will get if you ordered rice ) . Loved every bite of the dish though it looked slightly on the oily side . Would definitely come back on those days when I need a hearty meal ."
Pokka Cafe,4,"I'm such  a sucker for delicious coffee paired with adorably decadent desserts. If you think that's also an accurate description for yourself, then Pokka Cafe is for you.  This is my second time at this location and it did not disappoint. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Orders are accurate and they do a good job of communicating how long it will take. Coffee is expensive but it's wonderfully pressed to a nice concentration. Add a little cream and a touch of sugar and you've got a little cup of heaven in an adorable teacup. Our party of 9 split several snacks, both savory and sweet. A serving of chicken wings, noodle soup, beef wellington, and tiramisu toast. Be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes for the toast as it is made to order, but it's worth the wait and timed perfectly for a sweet ending to everything else. The toast was hot out of the oven and paired wonderfully with vanilla ice cream, custard, and a generous dusting of cocoa powder."
Shiro,5,"Have been to this place only a handful of times over the past 3 years . As with most Japanese managed companies, the restaurant serves consistently high quality Japanese dish . This is what keeps them in business as opposed to the other restaurants on the same street . ( side note : even my subway closed!)Shiro serves extremely decent sushi and with this comes a price . Lunch meals ranges usually from 200-400 HKd.On my most recent visit , I got adventurous and opted from their "" cooked "" food series (as oppose to sashimi which they do well ) . My lunch set consisted of half grilled scallop ( so good ), fried soft shell crab and grilled mackerel rice set . Everything was just so tasty and on point .  This place is good for dates and business meals"
Jade Garden,5,"Jade Garden has some really unique dim sum, and delicious. A particularly unique one is the dim sum that has 6 different types inside. One of which is a bun shaped like a mushroom. One the most delicious ones is the grilled glutinous rice with chicken inside. My personal favorite is the tofu pudding (豆腐花). It's difficult to find such smooth tofu pudding that rivals tofu pudding from street shops tended by generations of tofu masters. It was so good that we actually ate 3 meals there in one day. They also have delicious dinner dishes, especially the paper covered pork and the three bean pudding for dessert."
Jade Garden,3,"Visited for dim sum on a Saturday afternoon, around 12:00. Luckily enough shopping at Cityplaza was on my to-do list, so this family meal was relatively convenient. Our group (around 25) didn't have reservations,  so we got placed in one of the large sectioned off rooms, with another table of 4 people sitting there as well. Ordered dishes comparable to other dim sum locations - har gow, siu mai, bbq pork bun, rice noodles, carrot cake, fried rice, and many more. Taste wise it was alright on the most part. Food came hot and portions were decently sized. Most dishes started at around 40 HKD ~ 6 CAD, which is a bit expensive when compared to dim sum spots in Canada. Nonetheless, it seems to be a good place if you have a large group and are looking for a break between shopping in the Tai Koo Shing area. Disclaimer: I'm not a true dim sum enthusiast to begin with since I probably go once or maybe twice in a whole year."
Jade Garden,2,"Although the dim sum was great (BBQ pork bun, turnip and taro cakes were excellent), the service was poor and the servers were very rude, to put it mildly.  Recommend only for the food (the restaurant was packed with retired local couples, which I felt was a good sign for the dim sum quality)."
Butao Ramen,5,"I stayed in Hong Kong for 3 months and I looked for some good ramen places. Butao Ramen in Tai Koo was by far the best ramen I've had. I walked 20 minutes every time to get here, and it was always worth it. I usually go around 8 or 9 pm because there's less people. The small size of the restaurant doesn't bother me because of how few people there usually are around this time. The prices are a little expensive ~ around HKD$96, without any noodle refills or toppings.I usually get the Red King because I love spicy food. And I can tell you the spices are so rich and fulfilling. If you love noodles and soup, I can assure you you'll love the Red King at Butao. I've also tried the Black King, and it was alright. I definitely prefer the Red King over the Black. I tried the Red King with x4 spiciness level and it was just enough for me to be able to handle it. Any more spicy and it maybe would've been to hard to eat.The hospitality is great. The waitresses and waiters are always ready to help and they put a napkin on your lap right before you start eating. The place comes with free refillable lemon water. The ramen only takes about 5 minutes to prepare, so very fast service. They have an English and Chinese menu, so there's no need to worry about a language barrier. There will be at least one waiter/waitress who speaks English."
Butao Ramen,4,"I'm a huge fan of ramen and often go to the Butao Ramen restaurants in Taikoo Shing and Causeway Bay.The restaurant itself is rather small and crowded, so it's a bit difficult getting to your table. The staff, who are hospitable and work efficiently, will give you an order form to fill out after being seated. Food is delivered promptly. I never had to wait for too long, especially if there was a line, because you fill out your form while waiting in line, so that by the time you are seated, your food can be delivered soon after.Now, for the food itself, it's great! Since you can pretty much customise everything about your ramen, you can get the ramen you like. From the meat that goes into your ramen, to the noodle thickness, everything's pretty much up to you. The prices are also reasonable for the amount you get.If the restaurant itself wasn't so small, I'd give it 5 stars. If you're a ramen lover, definitely give Butao Ramen a try."
Shabu Sai,5,"Dinner all-you-can-eat$149 for (unlimited) prime beef$179 for ""selected prime beef""$219 for ""premium beef"" and also unlimited seafood$269 for wagyu beef and seafoodWe chose the cheapest option $149 + 10% per person, and still it was really really good! We were 3 people, and they gave us 4 plates of beef and 2 plates of pork. You can request for more beef once you're done!Food is SELF-SERVED!!!- a lot of vegetables: spinach x2, some other green leafs x2, bok choy, corn, tomatoes, onions, pumpkin- lotus root!- mushroom options are: enoki, shaggy ink cap, oyster mushroom, shiitake I think??- taro!!!- tofu- mini sausages with cheese inside- fried fishballs, cuttlefish balls, pork balls- chicken, fish$149 for AYCE hot-pot is a fantastic deal! Everyone gets their own pot, each pot with two soups of your choice. And the food is great quality also. Good beef, good pork, ok chicken and ok fish, and super good mushrooms! Fried fishballs, cuttlefish balls, and pork balls were all very very good.If you run out of soups, you simply take the jug from the centre and bring it back to your table. Everything is self-served!Definitely in love with this restaurant. SO BUSY THOUGH. Expect to wait 1 hour for walk-ins. But if you come at 5pm, it's quite empty!"
KimChee Korean Restaurant,4,"TL;DRthick-cut meats, slow to cook but chicken is delicious!AYCE dinner Korean barbeque, upstairs in the mall. It's fairly quiet. Drinks and desserts are self-serve on the other side of the restaurant. Food is ordered by a checklist menu.The menu is pretty long!! but it is almost all meats. With some nice soup and noodles options. The soups are actually really good!"
KimChee Korean Restaurant,2,"Food was pretty disappointed.we ordered  the combo BBQ meat dishes with BBQ chicken, sliced Beef and pork.taste was sweet and meet  was dried, no juce. . . well-seasoned but definitely too oily.  Overall, not worthwhile experience for the price and service and will not return."
Eat.it Al Volo,5,"I've been to their Causeway Bay branch several times and enjoyed the cafeteria style dining so I was pretty excited when they opened in Taikoo Place's Devon House. Although this is a toned down version compared to the other store, it still offers enough to qualify as a viable lunch option. During this visit, I was a little over zealous because I was super hungry but I just saved half of it for lunch the next day. I got the 3 choice salad (pumpkin, quinoa, and cous cous) and the tonno panini (tuna and eggs). Although it doesn't sound like it, the 3 choice salad is dense enough to fill up a growling stomach. I love that it's fresh and flavorful. The panini was crispy on the outside and hot on the inside. My only complaint about it is that the tuna had a little bit too much mayo. I generally eat my tuna with avocado instead of mayo though so any mayo is too much for me :P"
Cali-Mex,5,"Really great fast food Mexican food. Reminds me of chipotle in America. It's really clean, and the food options are great. They even offer vegan bacon burritos (I didn't try it)! I highly recommend going they also are able to customize your burrito once you choose a base burrito you want. I enjoyed my burrito and was so happy they offered jalapeños to put inside your burrito, they don't offer that at chipotle in America haha!They have nachos and they have happy hour buy two get 1 free margarita."
Cali-Mex,4,"As a self-proclaimed taco connoisseur (I lived in LA for 7 years, enough said), Cali-mex is 2.5 stars at best. However, when I review, I take into consideration of local competitions, I am also comparing it against with Chipotle, America's top cali mex restaurant. And I give Cali-mex a 3.5It must be noted that everyone's taco preference are different. I personally like my flour tacos soft (hard tacos are NOT authentic, but whatever floats your boat), al pastor or carne asada, from a grimey mexican food truck with a lot of cilantro, salsa and lime. I ordered 3 BEEF TACOS for $78, you can pay more for higher quality meat and I believe it was $98 for ANGUS STEAK CUBES. The food came somewhat quickly but there was no line.The tacos are HUGE. prepared to be STUFFED from 3 tacos. personally I think 2 is the perfect number for ones this size (authentic al pastor I usually get 4) So you may want to share instead of devouring it all for lunch. I also did not like how you had to order all 3 of the same meat. How difficult is it to scoop another meat? It's a bloody assembly line!I can tell the flour was not commercial ready made, it was fresh, however, it can do wonders heating up the tortilla first. I don't understand WHY this simple step is missed. It literally takes 5 seconds but makes it taste infinitely better.There were also no onion/coriander and cilantro (or very minimal) but they give a scooping of vegetables and some shredded cheese.They also ran out of medium salsa which was my first choice. I asked for light sour cream as I don't normally get my tacos with it, but I suppose that's how Tex-Mex does it (as does Chipotle)Note that it is $18 for guac, I don't normally get guac with my tacos so I skipped on that. Chipotle in LA charged $2.85usd for guac so I suppose this isn't ridiculous.***Tips: HUGE tacos, share if you can. Favourites: The salsa, the hottest one was quite similar to el taurino/king taco in LA, which is hard to come by!Meh: Forced to get 3 of the same tacos. Could not adjust portions. It ain't cheap.Last words: I've had brick house (superior but also very different) mr taco truck, (inferior). This is in all honesty a solid mexican joint in Hong Kong. BUT if you ever have a chance to head to seoul, Gusto tacos there is a definite 5. I heard they may explore HK, so watch out taco joints. Takeaway ONLY"
Cali-Mex,1,"I ve spent three years living in California and visited the Bay Area frequently thereafter and ate many many different sorts of tacos - from construction site food trucks to fine dine restaurants. To me, this is terrible taco... Nothing like what you will find California. I am actually quite pissed they are shamelessly calling themselves Californian style mexican food!! It s like blasphemy!!!Even Taco Bell tastes better. I ordered a steak taco... Too little meat and salsa. Meat not marinated long enough. Or maybe their seasoning s just not right. The tortilla is kind of luke warm / borderline cold. Salsa s bland with no character.Just read an article about their aggressive roll out plans and their management complaining about macau stealing away top talents from Hong Kong. I find it puzzling because you don't really need top chefs to make good tacos!!! It's an everyday food and you just need to get the recipe right and use fresh ingredients!!!Anyways, what can I say - good luck to all Cali Mex investors!!(Ps. I think the best taqueria (in a relative sense) in Hong Kong is Tacochaca in Kennedy town)"
Mos Burger,4,"I know it's silly, but I love dropping by mos burger whenever I am in HK as well. Mainly for their rice burger. I love rice burger! It surely is a lazy way of having a rice bowl in a burger form! It lives up to the ""fast"" food business:)I especially love their beef rice burger, it is as if you are having Yoshinoya beef bowl wrapped in a paper wrap with no utensils required. I love how their burger is always steaming hot (literally) that I have to double wrap the burger or it would burn my fingers. It is juicy and with pieces of cooked lettuces. It's definetely way better than having the traditional flour bun burger. To complete my meal, I usually get their matcha latte, either hot or cold, I feel fulfilled. Great stop for a quick lunch."
Cha Cha-More More Tea,5,"My go-to matcha green tea soft serve place in Tai Koo shing! They are a chain stores for soft serve that you are likely to find whenever you see a login store. They serve only the hokkaido milk and the matcha flavors. It is so creamy and rich in matcha! Just heavenly. Other than just ordering it plain on a cone, you could also order it with their traditional Japanese sweets like red Bean, mochi and their matcha jelly in a cup! It is definetely one of my favourite matcha soft serve place in hk !"
Pret A Manger,4,"Ah, good old Pret! A very speedy and convenient place to grab bfast or lunch! It was my go-to place for fast meals in Europe and now it is my go to place to grab a simple western meal in HK! Pret is not the greatest but it's is pretty decent for the price and taste! They serve an array of soups, salads, sandwiches, wraps, both hot and cold, as well as juices and fruit cups. You can usually look online on their website for their weekly soup menu. Their soups are pretty good actually. I love the tomato and creamy mushroom! Not a big fan of the kale and ham or pumpkin though. My favorite lunch items to get are their hot BBQ pork wraps and their toasties! Their cold Peking duck wrap is also good as well as their cold sandwiches. They also have Mac n cheese which is one of my favorite things to get! I've tried them all and the prosciutto and smoked salmon are the best! I am not a big fan of the kale and cauliflower... In the morning, their organic coffee/ lattes are pretty decent, similar to Pacific, and their croissants are pretty good as well. There isn't much seating inside so usually people grab their meal to go."
Pret A Manger,2,"Pret A Manger is a UK chain that serves salads and sandwiches that are pre-made for a quick grab and go lunch. They also serve coffee and have a variety of fruit juices and drinks. When we have an all day workshop or am working lunch, Pret is often provided as a lunch. I've gotten so sick of their food that I would often skip the free meal and either not eat or buy something else. Their sandwiches are really not any good. The crawfish sandwich at this point is the only one I can tolerate. The beat root quinoa salad is probably the only item I like and would be willing to pay money for out of my own pocket. Their cookies are also pretty good. These two things are the only reason why I don't give this place one star."
Pret A Manger,4,"Pret a Manger hardly needs an introduction, the British sandwich and coffee chain that's ubiquitous in working areas and has become a favorite among HK white collars. 'Pret a Manger' means 'Ready to eat' in French, but of course, my mom loves to tell me that she's at 'Pret a MANAGER'. The sell here is freshly made, no additive, soups, sandwiches and, salads that can be plucked straight off their shelves and consumed. There are 4 types of each food category (e.g. 4 different types of wraps - meatball, chicken tikka, pulled pork, falafel) every day, with one being a meatless choice. The quality of everything is decent, price is a bit higher than average (A salad costs HKD 5X and a hot wrap is HKD 4X). It is worthy to note that they bake everything in the morning and their cookies are surprisingly good - you can smell them if you pass by in the morning. Everything is sold same-day, everything left at day-closing is donated to Feeding Hong Kong, a charity that picks up their foods to serve the lesser privileged in the city. Not all stores do this though, but you can help, according to their site  - ""Tragically a few of our shops have no regular charities able to collect from them. If you are a Hong Kong registered charity and interested in collecting unsold sandwiches on a long term basis, please contact Gabrielle Kirstein at Feeding Hong Kong on Tel: 2205 6568"" Pret checks all the boxes to become a go-to lunch spot: convenient location (the Quarry Bay one is INSIDE Taikoo Place, no need to even go outdoors), quick service, fresh ingredients, decent flavor, reliability and a conscience (CSR is all the rage among young professionals). With just one drawback being the lack of variety - 4 choices of salad means you can only go so many times before repeating yourself - Quarry Bay Pret has become a canteen of sorts for the Taikoo Place workers, expect a bustling Monday to Thursday lunch, and emptiness during Friday (people actually eat 'out') and all dinnertimes."
Congee and Noodle Shop,4,"MICHELIN Guide 2018: Bib Gourmand * Inspectors' favourites for good valueCongee and Noodle 粥麵館 was not my first pick but since it is located right next to the hotel I was staying, we ended up coming here for dinner.I did have my hesitation when I walked into the empty restaurant. There was no one there and only another table of 2 shown up while we were dining here.Apparently they are really busy during lunch hours with all the commercial offices in the area. That is a little reassuring.We ordered congee and noodle (since this place is call congee and noodle, duh!) We really enjoyed the food here! The congee had this silky base and the wonton noodle was nice and chewy. Price is reasonable for a Michelin recommended restaurant but one might argue that it is a little more than other local places a short walk away."
Congee and Noodle Shop,4,"Although I'm not a frequent congee consumer, as I find the congee and noodle combination too carb-heavy for my carnivorous tastes, I can still appreciate the pleasures of a lighter diet, especially when I'm sick.So Congee and Noodle Shop became my venue of choice during my sick day. This shop has been ""Michelin-recommended"" so it seems to have some quality assurance, surprising thing is that whenever I go during lunchtime, there are always seats available. Guess congee isn't such a popular choice. The variety is wide though - you can get the traditional ones like what I had, Century Egg and Pork congee, to creative ones like Bitter Melon and Beef Congee or luxurious choices like Abalone and Chicken Congee. I've been a couple times and the quality is indeed consistently decent. Besides congee, they serve Guangdong style noodles, which I think is about average, and surprise, Claypot Rice! Apparently their rice is what earned them the holler from the Michelin people. I will have to take a look.Also, the seating and decor is more upscale than usual for a Congee and Noodle place, and thanks to the eternally available tables, it makes for a surprisingly decent place to have a lunch conversation."
奇味小廚,3,"Neighborhood joint that has been around for some years, serving local 'dai pai dong' style foods, for dinner or lunch. Lunch diners get a free item of soup, which comes in a generous container - we came in a party of four and each had two bowls already but didn't manage to finish it. The dishes are true to the grassroots wok-fried Chinese style: Expect grease, sodium and msg; the flavor was good and portions were hearty. Single person lunch sets start from HKD 48 and are one dish plus one white rice. But coming in a crew and ordering many dishes is the way to go. If you do it that way lunch and dinner are the same price, as the dishes are from the same menu expect ~HKD 80-100 each.Lunchtime is quite busy and expect a 10min wait even with a reservation, and nope, you are not welcome to stay and chitchat after your meal if they see someone waiting for a table outside."
Cafe de Coral,5,"This chain store is my favorable breakfast place.  I like the variety of breakfast from porridge to noodles and from eggs, thick toast to sausage/ham.   Milk tea in Hong Kong is usually superb and i have never had a place that makes bad milk tea (no disappointment).   The only thing i don't like is no business hours posted on yelp with most of the HK business.   I love 大家樂"
Hoi Yat Heen,5,"If you are looking for a decent dim sum place and somewhere you don't have to yell in order to talk ( you know what I'm saying because dim sum places are loud af). I will recommend this place! Hoi Yat Heen has pretty good dim sum, it is under Horizon Suite Hotel. A little pricey comparing to other places but you brought a comfy places to enjoy with your family and/or friends with!"
Tang’s Roast,5,"Cheapest lunch ever. If you work near one of these (I think it's a chain), you're in luck! You can get good quality (not the best of course) bbq meat with rice and a boxed drink (not chilled) for $20.If you can show me another place that sells lunchboxes for $20, I'll buy you lunch there ;) Anyways, the portion they give is standard, and the meat is yummy! It makes my day when they give me the legs ;) The char siu is thick and juicy too! They give you a lot of rice which I never finish. I'll ask for less rice next time.If you want 2 different meat, it's $2 more. If you want chilled canned drinks, it's $3***Tip: Cheapest lunch ever!Favourites: Cheap and good!Meh: Boxed drink is warm. No seats. Take-out ONLY. not environmentally friendly.Last words: cheap and good!"
Kam Kee Cafe,5,"A solid Hong Kong Style cafe inside Kornhill Plaza. Just be warned, this place is super busy. Use the GULU app to be in the queue for table is highly advised before arriving to the restaurant.Afternoon Tea set is perfect portion if you here for a snack. Rice noodle was stir fried with fresh off the wok aroma.Tables are set up really close to each other so not a place to linger over your milk tea. Order, Eat and Pay."
House of Canton Restaurant,5,"Our go to spot for excellent Cantonese food!  The Chinese BBQ pork buns with the sweet topping are delicious, and one could easily inhale 5 or 6 of these beauties. Great for large gatherings and can accommodate small banquets as well. The lines always seem long so try to make a reservation before hand.Enjoy!"
Mos Burger,5,This is a Japanese burger joint and it's location is located at the very bottom of the mall inside the supermarket.The last time I had Mos Burger was about 7+ years ago. I love their shrimp burger and the only thing I had from them was the shrimp burger.My impression of the shrimp burger was super amazing and it was the best thing of the world.The price of their product are cheaper than I expected! $28 for a shrimp burger + $20 comes with fries and a drink.The taste and the portion is very good for the price that you are paying in Hong Kong!
The Graces Restaurant,4,"This restaurant provides a nice view of Kornhill Plaza. You can see the buses, double decker trolleys, taxis, and pedestrians below as you enjoy your meal. We are dim sum here and got a plethora of foods. Their har gow is quite good, coming in the standard amount of four per steamer. There are often elderly folks who come to this place to dine and meet up with their friends. The ambiance is quite relaxing, although the workers do work at quite a fast pace to get orders out and prepare tables for the next guests arriving."
Wah Kee Store,5,"Being tugged away in the back alley of a busy street in Sai Wan Ho near the police station, you will find this traditional cafe hidden around the corner. You will most likely never paid attention and noticed it was there until you really look for it. And it was a pleasant food hunt. It is a tiny tiny store ( where I just realized 士多= store in english), that only have 4 indoor seatings and a back alley of tables and chairs. They only sell 2 dishes in the afternoon - omrice curry and pig's neck ginger rice. The two items is all it takes for foodies and neighbours to hover over this little hidden gem. There is literally no menu anywhere throughout the store and tables.For $35 , you get a drink and a large portion of rice dish. I ordered their signature omrice with curry. The rice under the omelette is almost like a clay pot rice with harder rice grains and pre stirred fired with chicken and soy sauce. So it definitely is a Chinese- Japanese fusion dish. Apparently you could also asked for no meat and add cheese to your rice. I wished I would have known it earlier, I would have added cheese :). What makes it so good, it's their omelette pour over rice, it is so silky and it covers as big as the plate goes! If you are egg lover, this surely is the place for you! What gives it 5 stars, is their cheap price for good quality food and the authentic, traditional hk food store where you could talk to the chef as you order. And nice servers which is hard to find in hk. It was a great local experience for me.Tip: They closed when they sell out of their food and rice, I would say if you come after 4pm, you are likely to be disappointed and would only see a closed gate. So come early!"
Wah Kee Store,4,"Local hk food stand located in a small street in Sai Wan Ho. They specialize in Japanese curry omelette rice with an HK twist. Food is tasty and the service is super efficient. The price has gone up a bit to 38 hkd but that is till a real bargain.  A bit more of you add cheese. I opted to not add the cheese since this dish is already really heavy.Food: 4 starsValue: 5 starsRecommendations: Japanese omelette riceThe food comes out really quick. Upon ordering I got my food served to me in less than five minutes. The rice also comes with a drink. Being a hk style cafe place I opted for the milk tea, which was quite good. Overall, glad I tried this place because it's a great value. Not something I would eat all the time because the food is really heavy."
Wah Kee Store,4,"This shop is highly recommended among instagram food bloggers. People mostly come here for their omurice ($35). The egg was cooked just right, soft and fluffy. It was covered by their curry sauce. The rice was not just plain white rice, but tasted like curry fried rice. It did not taste heavenly but definitely taste good and is an excellent value for money. It was only $35 with a drink. It is located at the back street. The shop is seriously small and people need to seat at temporary tables in the back street. If you are fine with the environment, then do come try it. Cash only.  Will definitely be back if I have a craving."
Ladies & Gentlemen Restaurant,2,"I think the only attractive point to this typical cha caan teng is the name of their dishes. They're cutely named as a gimmick. Their food is just mediocre at best and over priced. I guess I can't complain too much since they are in a prime location for the many workers in Taikoo Place. Their lunch sets range from about $55-65. My first experience was a takeaway order of black bean spare ribs with bell peppers over rice. For $60, I wish there were more pieces of ribs. My second experience was BBQ pork and over easy eggs with rice. The pork was tough, an odd color, and not a traditional BBQ pork flavor.Unless this is the only place open, I would go with other options."
NAHA Okinawa Restaurant,3,"Naha is a very solid Japanese offering at a good price point for a sit-down lunch in the Taikoo area.  The interior is a dark wood design and feels cozy and tucked away, even though we were sitting at a table in the middle of the restaurant.  We were on the early side of the lunch rush (right at noon) and the service was quite attentive in the early going.  The place got quite crowded towards the end of our meal and we ended up having to ask for the bill a couple of times -- no big deal, but I can see it being a bit annoying if we had been in a hurry.I had the Beef Teriyaki meal, which came with vegetables, rice and miso soup.  Everything was quite tasty, if perhaps unspectacular.  I can't say that anything was wrong, and my companions and I had a nice lunch.  The bill was also less than I expected (always a pleasant surprise).  If someone suggested it again I would go without hesitation, but I would not necessarily choose it on my own.  On the whole, a pretty decent option if you are looking for Japanese food in Taikoo."
NAHA Okinawa Restaurant,1,I ordered the sashimi don and the sashimi was so so - not fresh enough that was worth the price tag - the uni was thoroughly disappointing- looks like its been dug up from year 1800 - fresh uni is yellow moist and soft - it was dry grey and stiff - then served concentrated guava juice after - didnt even shake the juice to mix it up before servingService is just as bad - brought the sashimi way before the hot food - rather than syncing all the dishes to be brought to the table at the same time  - so i was  staring at  my food for a good 10 mins before all the food were brought- making my already un fresh sashimi even more un fresh - really sucks
North Viet Pho,4,What a surprise! I just needed a quick meal and anything would have worked with how hungry I was. Food was above average. I have had better but not at these prices. Coffee was amazing and most of the 4-stars.
North Viet Pho,2,The food here is below average. It's cheaper than most Vietnamese restaurants in Hong Kong. But even menu items like fried spring rolls and chicken wings which  are pretty hard to not make well aren't very good here. The spring rolls were greasy and not that crispy. The pho is passable and if I was really craving pho this is a passable version. The bun and the pork chop on the other hand I wouldn't order again. The grilled Vietnamese pork chop is something J love and this version just doesn't do the trick. Spend a little extra money and walk over to Nha Trang which is so much better.
North Viet Pho,5,"Located at the corner of an intersection. If you're craving pho then this is the place to go. Stopped by here one night after a long day and ordered one of their vermicelli dishes. I thought it was pretty good, they had the sauce readily available at the table to pour out onto your vermicelli. Down side was they didn't have cold water but that's not going to change my star rating since it is normal to be drinking warm/hot water here."
North Viet Pho,4,"Pho great, but sparse. Milk tea also authentic, little else. cheap!"
School Food,4,"Originated from Korea . The restaurant offers new modern style Korean food. Over the past year, I've tried this restaurant more than a handful of times  including at its most original branch, Seoul.If you haven't already known, Korea culture loves their their fried chicken. So I guess you can judge a Korean restaurant by their fried chicken ! If this is your first visit, I'd highly recommend that you try at least one dish of sushi, ""spaghetti"" made with Korean rice cake and their fried chicken shallot salad .  ( personally I will not recommend rice dish because I've been disappointed a few times )"
Misocool,3,"Misocool according to my foodie friends was initially famous for their konjac noodle. Sadly as with most restaurant in HK. there's a life cycle of hype with crazy queues, massive expansive of branches and then the die off period eventually.On my last visit to miso cool, I tried the set meal over lunch . the meal was disappointing and the quality has depreciated since I last tried it at the central branch . I opted for the eel rice ( which was not their specialty ) and the meat was dry . It felt like I was eating some very cheap local place but paying 70$ for it ."
Choi Wan Hin Seafood Restaurant,4,This place is always packed! Especially with locals - which is normally a good thing. I have been here for dinner and had their crazy lobster over noodle dish (out of this world) and their steamed fish (delicious as well). Their dim sum is pretty yummy. One of their best dishes were their ha gau (shrimp dumplings) and the ma tai gou (water chestnut pudding).
Cafe de Coral,4,"Great quick and affordable food. I got the bbq pork and shoyu chicken with tea. My husband got the curry rice. All were pretty good. I was impressed with the shoyu chicken. There are English subtitles to the menu so you can somewhat order in English. After ordering, you give your ticket to the food counter and wait for your food. I also noticed a lot of people ordered the sizzling platters."
Cafe de Coral,3,"I went here for an afternoon tea meal and I got the tea set with HK-style french toast and an iced red bean shake. I waited for 5 minutes for my order and was able to grab a table quickly. The french toast was good but not crispy. The iced red bean shake had condensed milk and lot of red beans. It was a good drink. Overall, I give this place a 3.5 stars."
ARISU Korean Restaurant,2,"My friends and I went to ARISU after buying a deal on Groupon for it - $99 for a fried chicken set, which has eight pieces, and two cans of beer. ARISU is located on Pan Hoi Street. To get there, walk along Tong Chong Street through Tai Koo Place and then make a right at the end. You have to walk past the garbage collection point, so it reeks pretty badly. To be honest, my first impression of it wasn't great. The street the restaurant was on looked littered and dirty, and the restaurant itself was much smaller than I had imagined it to be. It definitely couldn't sit more than fifty people at one time. Even so, the place looked cramped and actually reminded me of a cha chan teng.We were given two large plates of coleslaw before the fried chicken. It came with dishes of some sauce that was spicy, and I'm actually not sure if the sauce was meant for the coleslaw or for the fried chicken that as to come here. It felt a little weird to have coleslaw with spicy sauce, and there was already some thousand island dressing in the coleslaw itself. I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw so I just had a bit, but from what little I had of it, it tasted pretty fresh.The fried chicken took its time to come and took about fifteen to twenty minutes to arrive. The chicken came out nice and hot - a must for a good fried chicken. The meat was really tender, but its skin was quite fattening. It must have been a pretty small chicken too because there wasn't much meat on the bones. I liked that the chicken wasn't seasoned to be too salty though.I guess one thing that bothered me about this place was hygiene - I asked for a fork and knife because I didn't want to use my hands, and the handle of the knife felt a little oily. On the topic of cutlery, the chopsticks are the Korean metal ones and they're much flatter compared to regular chopsticks. My friends and I found them really hard to use! Overall, I don't think I would recommend coming to ARISU. While the fried chicken was good, the portion was small and the restaurant just seemed like it was in dire need of a good clean."
Mango Tree Cafe,3,"I would not come to Mango Tree Cafe for any authentic South East Asian food. More like a version of what Hong Kong people consider to me Thai, Malaysian food.I was here because of the location as it is inside Tai Koo Shing, easily accessible by MTR. Their lunch special is decent for what it is. You can get a set lunch for around $100. You can upgrade to includes a snack and a dessert.Service always quick and food serves fast."
Mango Tree Cafe,1,"My 90 year old mother likes to try the Thai menu. We showed up at 11:05 am. They opened at 11:30am. An employee was standing by the door busy looking at her electronic device and didn't bother to acknowledge our presence. She could have said, ""we will open shortly."" Nope . We convinced mom to patronize some place else. In the evening mom suggested to go there for dinner. We showed up at 5:30pm. Similar situation with similar deflection to another restaurant.This morning mom suggested to try the place again. One may think that three times is a charm.We showed up at 11:28am. Same employee showed the same attitude. A waiter was walking around and talking to the employee without bothering to acknowledge our presence right outside the door. Mom is wheelchair bound!We were seated. We ordered pineapples and seafood with rice, pepper steak with white rice, and baked pork chop with rice. Each came with a drink: coffee , tea, or lemongrass tea. The dishes were good.However the service sucks! We won't patronize the restaurant and won't recommend to our traveling friends, including ourselves."
Mango Tree Cafe,2,"My grandma and other family members came here the past three days. We accidentally came a bit too early. The staff here are not welcoming or accommodating. How hard is it to say hi to guests who are clearly excited to have a meal at your restaurant, especially three times in a row? One of us is in a wheelchair. The three previous times we left for other restaurants. We finally went in but even at exactly 11:30am, their opening time, the hosts at the front pretended we weren't there waiting. Just in general really unprofessional."
Mango Tree Cafe,2,"You know when the pictures in the food menu look amazing but then it actually tastes meh? Yeah, that's this place."
sen-ryo,4,Really extensive menu so it's a bit overwhelming! Loved the sashimi & nigiri - particularly yellowtail and sweet shrimp. Eel was just okay and comes with your own packet of eel sauce to add on as you like. Salmon cheek / jaw is also good. Really can't go wrong with this one though! I also really appreciate the matcha green tea and having the matcha powder and hot water pitcher on the table ready for refills.
Umimachidon,4,"Quaint Japanese restaurant in Quarry Bay that specializes is sushi rice sets. They offer a standard, deluxe and premium options where the premium has more expensive ingredients like unit and shrimp. For the non sashimi eaters they do offer egg donburi options. The seating at this place is fairly limited, but the turnover is fast. Recommend for a quick and affordable bite to eat. Food: 4 starsEnvironment/service: 3.5 stars Value: 5 stars"
Ground Public,3,"The public is located on the ground floor of the one island east building. It is basically a grab and go food place that offers made to order espresso drinks, bottled drinks, and simple food items. The pastry items are ok and something I don't order often. The food is below average and I would say as a comparison slightly worse than what you can get at Simply Life cafe.  During lunch times they have ""salads"" which is a liberal interpretation. The salad choices often includes pasta salad or a rice salad. If you are trying to eat healthy and lite then the salads here aren't for you.The coffee here is pretty good however and is slightly cheaper than the coffee shops in the area. They also have a loyalty program so you get a free coffee after buying 10. I personally like their cappuccino and think it's better than the Coffee Academics and Starbucks version which are your other choices close by. They recently changed up the menu and offer more low carb friendly options which are geared to the paleo/ketogenic diet crowd. An example is the cauliflower rice option that they sell.This isn't a place I would recommend to go out of your way to go to. If you work in the office building it's a convenient choice for something quick. Seating usually isn't an issue either which is a bit of a luxury in Hong Kong."
Ground Public,3,Ground Public is located in the lobby of a Office Building. The spacious and open set up is quite inviting. A good place for people that works in the office to come here for a coffee break or to grab a quick snack.Macchiato ($17) was so so. But I think most people here probably not just for their coffee.Coffee Academia just a short walk away serves much better coffee but for double the prices.
Hop Sze Restaurant,5,"Still a hidden gem, but starting to spread among food connoisseurs and celebrities. The owner is passionate about food, and keeps developing good Cantonese food. West Villa is well-known Canto food... Hop Sze is hidden gem Canto food. Both considered one of the best Canto restaurants now in Hong Kong. We started with the Almond Pig Lung soup (so tasty), then we had a full pigeon each, then steamed fish, followed by crab with cheung fun to soak up the sauce, and then there was a plate of greens and finally beef rice noodle pancakes (awesome way to cook rice noodles in pancake form!) The best specialty dishes are prepared if you reserve and ask the owner to help you order (at least 2 days ahead is better), otherwise walk-ins are the usual Canto dishes, still good tho."
Hop Sze Restaurant,4,"I will return to this restaurant and update a better review than I am about to write right now.  I took no photos and I did not make note of the specifics of exactly what we ate...we were entranced with the large group of people we were with and the experience of a great meal.  Just because I am lacking in my review, I felt I would be doing a disservice to the Yelp community and Hop Sze by writing nothing.  We went to this restaurant because we were invited to attend a large group dinner with people who live in the area of Sai Wan Ho.  This group has followed the chef of this restaurant collectively as a group for over 10 years (surely this alone says alot about this restaurant!). Staff was super friendly and accomodating...although I think limited if any English for the most part. There is a small dining area when you walk in that is open to the public.  We were ushed through and went up some stairs to another floor, where there was another dining room set up with three giant tables for our group. Restaurant is clean, current, up to date.  Clearly, they have space for a group.  We had exceptionally delicious fish dishes.  Most of them were fish dishes made by this chef that this group has known and follow for 10 years.  Exceptional fish, highest of quality and presentation was beautiful.  We will go back sometime and I will be better with my photos and update my review with better specifics."
Hop Sze Restaurant,3,"It was highly recommended to us. We made reservation and had 8 in the party, including our wheel-chaired bound mother to the restaurant. The restaurant is quite pleasant but very small on the first floor. We had to squeeze the wheel chair against the wall and sit at the very front of the restaurant. So, you have been warned. We ordered two ""must"" dishes. The: 杏汁豬肺湯 (apricot flavored pork lung soup) was not disappointing, but the price was steep - HK$50 ;per person. The 鼓油鷄 (soya sauce chicken) was soft and tasty. The other three dishes: fish fillet, sauteed vegetables, and pork chops were ordinary with smaller servings. The service was not as attentive. They need to be more friendly and pleasant."
sensory ZERO,4,"The shop is conveniently located inside the Eslite Spectrum, it is good for people who have enough of walking and books and want to take a little break. The shop itself is pretty small, but there is an outside-the-shop seating area that is more spacious and comfortable. I preferred seating there. I ordered a bagel of the day, which was ham and cheese bagel. I have been hunting for local bagels ever since I am back from Canada, so this is a must try. The bagel was pretty good, it got a crisp exterior but not hardened. Well, I do prefer bagel with cream cheese, so I'll come again to try my luck. Any one have good options for having bagels in Hong Kong? *thanks in advance* HAHAAnother thing I picked out from the menu was a cold raman with tofu. The raman wasn't chewy in particular, but I liked the sesame dressing and the slimy lady's fingers. A refreshing vegetarian dish from this shop. In fact, the shop is offering many light dishes. If you are looking for some fresh options nearby you can try it out. They served some special coffee menu e.g. the sparkling coffee. I got the orange one and it tasted like coffee mixing with orange soda. Kind of an interesting feeling to have sparkling coffee. The hot chocolate was creamy and rich as well.I liked the relaxing environment being surrounded by food and books. I'll definitely come again another time when I am visiting Eslite Spectrum."
Nakayo Shokudou,4,"Exceptional fish from a food court restaurant located on the ground floor inside Aeon. They specialized only raw fish and grilled fish, like chirashi bowl, or torched seafood bowl and their delicious yellow tail collar. However, they get fairly busy for lunch and dinner and they will sell out their dishes if you come too late. I came around 1ish for lunch,  and have to wait for about 30 min to be seated (waited extra 15 min for a regular table other then by the bar). By the time I finally got seated, the dish that I wanted to try waa so out. It was a torched seafood bowl with scallops and shrimp and salmon belly... I know it sounds super yummy, but they ran out of the salmon belly. I went quite immediate hangry and just ordered their yellowtail collar instead. ( was initially ordered both instead of one)At least the food really made up for the unsatisfy feeling of their sold out dishes. Their grilled yellowtail collar was one of the best that I had in the area.  It is better than some of the Japanese restaurant around( and there's a lot in tai koo)  the portion might not be the bigger, would say it's medium to a small medium collar. But EVERY bite of the collar was just so moist and juicy with a yuzu fragmented salt. It was a very simple yet well prepared dish. The skin was very crispy, and it was salted just right that I could even eat up all of the skin.  The set comes with a bowl of rice,  soup ( more like a daikon, carrot vegetable soup than usual miso) , some pickled radish And fried yam. I like how they added just a couple finely grated orange peel to the pickled radish. The citrus aroma rolls along with the salted fish in between bites. It was a very nice touch and detail that they added to a simple side dish. Being said I enjoyed very much.Although, it is part of the food court area even though they will seat you in a separated area. So it's not a restaurant setup if you are looking for a place for date. Still food is great , stool wish I get to try the torched salmon belly and scallops. Another day."
Pacific Coffee,4,"If you want to try a local chain that is comparable to SB, this is the place to come. Plenty of tables, chairs, and even sofa."
Pregio,4,"My all time favorite cafe in HK. If you're are looking for speciality coffee, this is the place for you. Coffee beans are roasted locally, baristas are professional.For the food, they change their menu from time to time. Their waffles are GOOD!"
The Spaghetti House,4,"Came by for lunch the other day and was surprised to see that they opened at noon... There was a queue of folks that were lined upon right at opening. There are some talented staff working so keep a close eye out and enjoy! ;)Started the meal off with the baked spinach and cheese which was surprisingly decent! The cheese wasn't too overpowering and the spinach was fresh.Moved on to the lobster bisque with puff pastry and it was okay. There didn't seem to be too much lobster in the bisque that was pretty watery... at least the puff pastry seemed decent.The chicken fettuccine was also surprisingly decent as the noodles were cooked to a perfect al dente and the noodles tasted fresh, along with the chicken! Despite using a cream sauce, the dish wasn't too over-powering either.The sampler complemented the meal quite well with an assortment of small bites to finish off the meal.Service was okay throughout the meal. As there was a queue of folks at the door, one must quickly move on after dining..."
McDonald’s,4,"Super busy McDonalds... We ordered using one of the 3 touch screens available. We were looking for items we could only get in HK so I think the people waiting behind us were annoyed lol. I'm not sure how long we waited for our food, but there were at least 10 other orders ahead of ours so it was a while. Much longer wait than the ones in the US. We ordered a Corn Pie, Fries with Crab Seasoning, Milk Tea and Cookie McFlurry, and a Lemon Soda. Corn pie was a-okay.. nothing special. The fries were identical to US fries, but I was digging the seasoning. No need for ketchup with seasoning. You do have to pay extra for it and it comes in a separate package so you can determine how much seasoning the fries need. I never order McFlurries in the States, but when I saw it was milk tea flavor I couldn't resist. It was delicious! Flavors were spot on. The lemon soda was pretty good too. Refreshing. Very close to the Monster Building in Quarry Bay. Bathroom is located all the way in the back and outside of the McDonalds location."
Chao Chao Gyoza,4,Chao Chao is a gyoza dumpling chain from Japan. I have eaten here a few times in Tokyo and can attest that the quality at this outlet is similar to the ones in Japan. My four star rating is based on the following:Food: 5 starsEnvironment/service: 3 starsValue: 4 starsRecommendations: the original Chao Chao gyozaAs the name states they specialize in gyoza and have little else on the menu. They offer all types of gyoza fillings and the number of varieties is quite impressive. They do offer some noodle options for their lunch set so you can have a real meal here if you like but what you want to order are the dumplings.The gyozas here are very good. There is a nice crispness to the skin and the meat to wrapper ratio is well balanced. I've come here a number of times for a quick and delicious snack.
Grand Cuisine Shanghai Kitchen,3,"As the name implies Shanghai kitchen serves your typical Shanghainese dishes. You can find xiao long bao, Shanghai fried noodles, vegetable rice, lions head meatballs here. The food is decent and is not a bad choice if you want to have dumplings and you are in the area. My rating is based on the following:Food: 3.5 starsAtmosphere: 3 starsValue: 3 starsThis place gets really busy during lunch times so try to get here before 12:30. There is no lunch set so this restaurants better suited if you go with a group of people and share a set of dishes. They do have a afternoon tea set which I have yet to try."
CIAK - All Day Italian,4,"Once seated, Crispy and hot house bread served, bread is repeatedly served upon request. Oh , so yummy. Forgot to take photos on cod fish soup, scallop spaghetti and pork loin"
CIAK - All Day Italian,3,"Michelin rated Parma pizza.... yes please ! Ideal for a business lunch without feeling too overly formal nor casual. I've visited this place at least 4-5 times in past years and it's a place that I will never reject . 2 course meal cost around 144 HKD and if you are feeling hungry you can opt for the 3 course meal for 188. Being famous for their pizza ,  I'd recommend that you try it at least once . The crust is freshly baked to perfection !. Yum"
元気寿司,4,"A pretty new concept.  Order on the screen and the food will be arrived on the train set.   Good temperature on the food.  Afternoon special costs about HK$60 with salmon sashimi, three pieces of sushi, cucumber salad and steamed eggs.  Great value"
Maxim’s MX,4,"The Hainan Chicken rice is one of the best that I've had. Their Honey BBQ pork is also a favorite. However, the pork, shrimp, egg pancake rice is mediocre. Regardless, the food quality at this MX can be expected to be reliably good."
Starbucks,4,"This Starbucks has both a normal Starbucks and a Starbucks reserve.  My review is for the Starbucks reserve. I'm typically not a fan of Starbucks coffee because their roast is very dark and I prefer lighter roasts. Even their coffee that claims to be medium or light is still dark. Overall I would rate the coffee here 3.5 stars. The reason I give four stars is because of their nitro cold brew. Generally speaking the coffee in Hong Kong is very good and it is easy to find high quality coffee around town. However, finding a good nitro cold brew has been very difficult. I haven't had anything that would compare to a Stumptown in the states. In fact most of the time ordering a nitro cold brew I have trouble finishing it because it just tastes bad.So far the Starbucks reserve has the best nitro cold brew I've had in HK. You get a nice head of foam and the mouth feel is similar to drinking a stout. The coffee is cool and refreshing and really nice for a hot day in Hong Kong. The price for a pour over is relatively cheap compared to a copping room or Coffee academics or fill in your blank specialty coffee store. I've lived in Hong Kong for almost two years and still amazed at how expensive coffee is here. Try to avoid coming here in the morning. The staffing is not adequate for the demand and you will need to wait. I have seen some complaints about the service in some reviews. I have not had that problem most of the time. Only when they are really busy and understaffed."
Kyo Hayashiya,4,"The 2nd location of Kyo Hayashiya in Hong Kong.京林屋 is originally from Kyoto and been in business since 1753. This location is not as busy as the Causeway Bay location at Hysan Place. When we visited, the restaurant was half full and we were seated promptly.Their dessert tea sets which I always order is good value for under HKD$100 and includes a drink.And of course I always go with their Matcha and Hōjicha ice cream parfait.Great option if you are in the neighbourhood and want to have a snack or meet up with your friends!"
王朝盛宴,4,"I came to this place to eat some dim sum (點心/飲茶，yum cha) with a local Hong Kong friend on a Sunday. The English name of this place is ""Dynasty Feast"". Most of the people that were there at that time were elderly people. We ordered the typical dim sum dishes and added in some extra dishes which included the following:燒賣 - siu mai - pork and shrimp dumpling蝦餃 - ha gau - shrimp dumpling蘿蔔糕 - lo bak gou - turnip cake牛肉腸粉 - ngau youk cheung fun - beef wrapped in rice noodles鳳爪 - fung jau - chicken feet煲仔雞飯 - bo jai gai fan - rice with chicken, Chinese sausage in a clay pot燒肉 - siu youk - crispy roasted pork小籠包 - siu lung bau - Xiao Long Bao, soup dumplingsI haven't had dim sum for a long time and I was pretty hungry, so all of the the food tasted pretty good to me. The 燒賣 and the 蝦餃 tasted fine and fulfilled my dim sum cravings. The 蘿蔔糕 needed some more crispiness but was still good, the 牛肉腸粉 was a little soggy but good, the flavour of the 鳳爪 was decent, the 煲仔雞飯 was tasty, 燒肉 had a good crisp, and the 小籠包 was just ok, but I have really low expectations for 小籠包 in Hong Kong anyway. Service was fine and was pretty quick when we were there. Overall, I did have some good dim sum here, but I would not say it is the best place to get dim sum in Hong Kong, unless you happen to be at this neighbourhood on a Saturday morning after a restful evening."
津津茶餐廳,4,"This place has been around for some time. The food is great and the place is small; it is a bit further than the usual Taikoo place haunts and hardly visible under a footbridge, so it takes longer to fill up than other places.Be here before 12:40 and you will likely have seats. They're most famous for the Salt Baked Chicken with Ginger Sand 沙姜雞. My translation doesn't sound appetizing, but trust me, it is very much so. My foreign friend who joined me was like ""Omg the ginger sand alone isn't much but together with the chicken it is like WAAA"". WAAA is the word for this humble place. 6 of us shared a whole chicken, 2 sautéed vegetables and a rice and soup each.  HK 372 (62 each). Come by for cramped seating and satisfied tastebuds."
Si Fang Cheng,4,"Si Fang Cheng makes pretty good cart noodles! For those not familiar with cart noodles you basically choose the type of noodle you want, the broth type, and then choose the toppings individually.  Unfortunately they don't have an English menu available. And the menu is a piece of paper you mark off to place the order. The queue here at lunch time can vary. Sometimes it's quick sometime it's long since there's not too many seats available. I've tried the different broths and be warned that their spicy ones are pretty spicy!  Aside from soup base noodles you may also order their dry noodle. Same concept but minus the soup.  Overall I quite like this restaurant. Nothing like a hot bowl of noodle on a cold day."
Passion by Gerard Dubois,3,"I know Passion is better known for their pastries, but only had lunch and nothing else at this location.During my visit, I had the porchini mushroom risotto, which was okay overall. Service is speedy as you'd expect from passion, and the quality for non-pastries is at least satisfactory, as you would expect from a premium chain like this.The porcini mushroom risotto was okay. The rice had the texture that you'd expect of a risotto, soft but with a slight chewiness. The sauce was flavourful and creamy, but unfortunately the mushrooms were a bit gooey- they probably could've done with chopping the mushroom into smaller pieces.Overall, this was a good experience. I have to update this review sometime when I get pastries with my meal."
Passion by Gerard Dubois,2,"A pathetic portion of salad (250g to be exact) for whooping HKD 45. For your information and entertainment, they actually weigh your salad right in front of your face. So don't opt for that heavy weighted potatoes salad.I tried the pasta salad, chicken salad and quinoa. To be fair the salad taste was great but it's just too little to keep me full for the rest of the day . Environment wise, we sat in the open area in taikoo mall and ambiance was more food court style like (i.e. Find your own seat, expect no one to clean the table ) . Will probably never return for salad / dessert . This is my second visit and am still left with disappointment ."
Passion by Gerard Dubois,3,"Pleasantly surprised.  We were in the mall and needed to feed the kids it was late and every other place we wanted to go was full.We ordered Spaghetti Bolognese, Spaghetti with pesto and Spaghetti with tomato sauce. Plus one plain pasta. It came out super fast and they were all really good.  The price was also very reasonable. We got some ice cream and pastry for dessert there also. In and out in 30 minutes on a good price with friendly service - a win for sure."
Cafe de Coral,4,This place is very closed to where i stay in Hong Kong and i like the location.  It is not too crowded.  Food is the standard fast food.  Nothing much to comment about and i just like to share the business hours for you guys.   I have posted a photo of the business hours.
Pizza Express,3,"Came by for dinner the other night and the experience was mediocre at best. Pizza Express took over the Macau Cafe and the restaurant has now been fully remodeled for a Western theme.To HK Locals, this place apparently appeared to be a hit. From a foreigner's perspective, this place was a miss.We were served by a big and buff ""gwai lo"" that spoke fluent Cantonese?!?Salad- Quality was decent and portions were decent. Perfect for sharing.Pizza- Toppings were light and the crust was mediocre. I guess with little competition, the locals have little to compare against...Pasta- Didn't seem homemade and didn't have much toppings.Net net, this was a carb and vegetable meal with little protein...didn't quite understand the hype.."
Pizza Express,2,"I tried Pizza Express for the first time two years ago when it first came out. I remember they made really good authentic Italian Pizza. So yesterday when I took my parents out for dinner I was hoping for the best. It was a real disappointment. We got the soup of the day, which was the cream of mushroom soup. It smelled really good probably because they added some truffle oil, but it tasted pretty blend. Honestly I would have picked the Campbell mushroom soup over the $50 soup of the day. The baked mushroom could have more seasoning as well. Nothing too special. And then I thought they could make it up with the pizza but no it didn't happen. We ordered the King Cole pizza. It had duck breast and mushroom on top. The toppings were not distributed evenly across the pizza. I literally ate a slice without toppings for the most part. The crust wasn't crunchy. It's under-seasoned.Overall it was a disappointing experience. There are far more qualified restaurants out here in Hong Kong so I probably won't come again."
Peony Cafe,5,"Peony Cafe is one of my favorite cafes in Hong Kong! It's true that the cafe is super small and can only accommodate less than 10 people, but I really like the hominess of it! This cafe is locally famous and has been featured in multiple Hong Kong gourmet magazines. All cakes and small dishes are homemade! The people there are really nice but sometimes when things get a little hectic you have to wait outside of the cafe to get seated. Some of my recommendations include the Irish Chocolate, Mushroom Pie and all of their cheesecakes. Actually getting an angel hair / spaghetti for lunch is pretty nice too. :) Highly recommended!"
On-Yasai,3,"On-Yasai is a Japanese shabu shabu chain with multiple locations in Hong Kong. The City Plaza branch just opened a few months ago. My three star review is based on the following:Food: 4 starsService: 1.5 starsAtmosphere: 2 starsValue: 3 starsRecommended dishes: 12 spice pot, pork belly, pork neck, beef short ribThe food here is actually pretty good. The quality of the meat is high and even for the more economical cuts the meat is still good. I prefer the pork over the beef and surprisingly I prefer the short rib over the wagyu cuts. The waygu fell apart really easily and was difficult to eat. You will need to order an individual pot for each person and they have various types of soup. I have tried the seaweed and the 12 spice pot. I prefer the 12 spice pot over the seaweed. It was much more flavorful. The nice thing about the pot is the soup base is not too oil and you can drink the soup if you like. The soup is not going to be too strongly flavored. Some will like that and some will think it's bland. I personally enjoyed having a lighter soup and didn't feel gross after finishing my meal.The service here is pretty bad. The menu is really disorganized and has multiple pages.  There is a separate menu for ordering a set or a la carte. No one explained anything to us. Additionally, you need to order using an iPad which is pretty intuitive but if you never been here before it would be really helpful for an explanation. The design of this place is really bad. For a party of two the table is just way too small. Most hot pot places there is a trey to the side of the table where you can put your raw meat, vegetables, etc. Here there isn't enough room so they had to stack the items on the table. Our waitress while putting our food on the table knocked over my tea and spilled tea all over my phone. I have come here both for lunch and dinner. The lunch set is a much better value and I would recommend coming here during lunch time if you want to give this place a try."
M&S Cafe,3,"A solid option for a quick lunch if you find yourself in Cityplaza (or work there like I do).  While they do have full food options (pasta, lasagna, curries) those seem to be prepackaged and reheated, put on a plate and then served.  The spaghetti bolognese was oily and greasy and I probably would not order it again.  To be honest, after I saw the guy behind the counter pull a ""spaghetti bolognese"" package out of the fridge and pull the plastic wrapping off I regretted my order pretty quickly.The mains aside, M&S Cafe has quality pre-made sandwiches that fit the bill for a quick lunch while at the office or shopping.  I am particular fond of the chicken cesar baguette, which is filling and well-priced for a Hong Kong lunch at around $45.  They also have ham and cheese ploughman's on a variety of different breads, all of which can be served hot or cold.Although I have not tried it (it's just a quick work lunch spot for me), the afternoon tea sets look quite nice and I often see a few friends lingering over cakes and tea.  I could see that being a nice treat if you were out for a day of shopping.I visit M&S Cafe fairly regularly because it's well-priced, the sandwiches are good, service is fast, you can always find a table and they also have free WiFi.  By my math that adds up to a solid lunch option!"
The Soupaholic,3,"Quarry Bay actually has a fair share of ethnic food places, and Soupaholic is one of them. Extremely small and tucked away in a small alley that also houses Japanese, Korean, Yunan and Indian cuisine, this store only serves two types of food: Bak Kut Teh and Laksa. I first tried their Laksa, which was exploding with flavor, and pretty well stocked with ingredients - shrimp, tofu, crab etc. There is also a deluxe version of this noodle as well. The portion isn't that large so big eaters be warned, you might want to order two. Also, the spiciness is just right for me, but maybe will feel a bit heavy when summer comes along. There's a bit of msg in it though, they were honest enough to put this on the menu in small print. The Bak Kut Teh on the other hand, has no msg, as the giant words on the menu says. The portions are ok, the soup is a bit herbal-y and light, especially when compared to their other dish, the laksa. Quite fragrant though. And the meat was tender and fell off the bone, and was greatly helped in flavor by the spicy doing soy sauce. For some reason the rice was reaaally hard. Not in a sushi rice kind of way, but in a try-to-chew-a-mouthful-of-multivitamins hard. I dumped all the soup into the rice and just drank it.This is a nice place that focuses on doing the basics well. Just hope that they also pay attention to some details and get a bigger store."
